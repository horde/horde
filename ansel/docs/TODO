 Ansel Development TODO List
=============================

:Contact:       ansel@lists.horde.org

- Further abstract out all database access from Ansel_Gallery/Ansel_Image and
  place in Ansel_Storage. Likewise, consolidate the static Ansel_Tags methods
  into the Ansel_Storage class.

- A command line script for batch importing/exporting/management of galleries
  (importing is done).

- Complete XMLRPC/SOAP API that remote programs can use to upload/edit/manage
  images.
