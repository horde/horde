The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first alpha release of the Ansel
Photo Management and Web Gallery application version H4 (2.0-ALPHA1).

Ansel is a full featured photo management application. With it, you can organize
your photos in any number of galleries and subgalleries, share galleries among
other Horde users or make them public. Ansel supports a wide range of
features. See http://horde.org/ansel for more information.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated and new translations are very welcome, though some
strings might still change before the final release.

Major changes compared to the Ansel H3 versions are:
    * Updated to work with Horde 4.
    * Added a mobile view.
    * Added new thumbnail types and processing options.
    * Added Twitter notifications after uploading images.
    * Now uses the global Horde tagging system.
    * New, improved uploader.
    * Improved geotagging features based on OpenLayers.
    * Improved Exif support.
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.
