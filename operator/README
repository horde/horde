What is Operator?
=================

.. contents:: Contents
.. section-numbering::

Operator is an application to read call detail records out of an SQL database
and allow the user to view those records.

Today it is a read-only user interface with very limited search capabilities.
In the future the goal is to allow for sorting by arbitrary fields, more
advanced search criteria, exporting of search results, per-account-code
security (to allow for CDR self-service), rule-based call rating and more.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.
