Hermes is a Horde time-tracking application. It ties into address books (to
retrieve clients) and task lists, bug trackers etc. (to retrieve cost
objects). It comes with a stop watch, search and reporting capabilities, a
MacOSX Dashboard widget and an invoice interface.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.

Installation
============

Instructions for installing Hermes can be found in the file INSTALL_ in the
``docs/`` directory of the Hermes distribution.


Configuration
=============

Editing Submitted Time
----------------------

By default, users cannot edit submitted time.  Specific users or groups can be
granted the ability to edit submitted (but not exported) time by granting the
"EDIT" permission for "Hermes -> Time Review Screen" (see "Permissions" from
the Administration menu for more info).  This will enable them to edit
submitted time from anywhere they can see it, which right means from the
Search screen.

This permission also gives the user the ability to mark time as exported when
downloading it.

Cost Objects
------------

Other applications can supply cost objects to track time against.

Currently, Whups_ (the ticket-tracking system) will export its tickets as
possible cost object. If you configure an additional attribute for your ticket
types and make its name "Estimated Time", Whups will also be able to export
estimates on the tickets, allowing Hermes to indicate the ticket's percentage
complete. The same happens automatically with tasks exported from Nag_ as cost
objects.

.. _Nag: http://www.horde.org/apps/nag


Using the OS X Widget
=====================

If you are running Apple's OS X version 10.4 (Tiger) or later you can use the
included widget, Sandals, to enter time directly from the Dashboard. Sandals
can be found in the scripts/ directory. The easiest way to install it is to
create a .zip of the directory and copy that to the OS X computer. After
decompressing the .zip on the Mac, double-click the widget icon and it will be
installed into your Dashboard.

To use Sandals you must configure the Horde URL to rpc.php along with your
username and password. Horde's rpc.php can be found in the base directory of
your Horde install. Example: http://www.example.com/horde/rpc.php

A note about security: If you are using OS X 10.5 (Leopard) your username and
password will be securely stored in your Keychain. For 10.4 the credentials
are stored in the normal Dashboard preferences unencrypted. If this is an
issue for you, you should not use Sandals on OS X 10.4.
