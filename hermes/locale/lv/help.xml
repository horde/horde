    <title>Submitting Time Slices</title>
    <para>Submitting time slices "marks" them as finshed. This is
    also a sign for the administrator or bookkeeping department that they are
    ready to be further processed. As long as you didn't submit your slices,
    they are still considered due to be changed, but after submitting them you
    can no longer change them.</para>
    <heading>Submitting Certain Time Slices</heading>
    <para>While this cannot be easily achieved from the default time slice
    view, which shows all time slices for all clients, and the tabs simply
    group the time slices differently, this can be accomplished by using the
    search facility. Set the "Submitted?" field to "No"
    and select any other criteria from the various from fields, then click
    "Search".</para>
    <para>On submission of the search form in that way, you are presented with
    a view just like the initial time slice view, but containing just the
    slices with the picked criteria, with all checkboxes already checked, so
    you can just click "Submit Selected Time" to do so.</para>
