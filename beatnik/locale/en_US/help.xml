    <heading>Timestamp</heading>
    <para>This field is available only with the "ldap2dns" backend.</para>

    <para>The Timestamp field provides tell the DNS server "Do Not Issue Before"
        or "Do Not Issue After" a particular time.  If the "ttl" field is
        nonzero or omitted, "timestamp" indicates a starting time for the record
        to be valid.  If "ttl" is 0 the timestamp is an ending time, after which
        the record will no longer be served.  <a href="http://cr.yp.to">tinydns
        </a> will automatically adjust the ttl so that the record should not be
        cached for more than a few seconds beyond the expiry.
    </para>

    <para>The format of the record is the number of seconds since midnight of
        January 1st, 1970 expressed in TAI64, a 16 character hexadecimal string.
