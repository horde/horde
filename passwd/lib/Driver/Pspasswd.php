/**
 * The PSPasswd class changes a user's password on any Windows Machine
 * (NT+) using the pspasswd free utility available at Sysinternals
 * website: http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pspasswd.shtml
 *
 * IMPORTANT!
 *
 * This driver should be used only as a last resort when there's no
 * possibility of using the ADSI or LDAP drivers, which are far more
 * secure and fast. This driver needs administrative credentials
 * exposed on the backends.php file, which is required by the
 * pspasswd.exe tool. It's an alternative driver that should be
 * avoided, but could also be the only option for a few scenarios.
 * (eg: When you don't have ADSI or LDAP support)
 *
 * Sample backend configuration:
 * <code>
 * $backends['pspasswd'] = array(
 *   'name' => 'Sample pspasswd backend',
 *   'preferred' => 'localhost',
 *   'password policy' => array(
 *       'minLength' => 8,
 *       'maxLength' => 14
 *   ),
 *   'driver' => 'pspasswd',
 *   'params' => array(
 *		 'server' => 'YOUR_SERVER_NAME',
 *		 'bin' => 'DRIVE:\\DIR\\pspasswd.exe', // Notice: "\\"
 *		 'admusr' => 'Administrator',
 *	  	 'admpwd' => 'Password',
 *       'domain' => 'YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME'
 *   )
 * );
 * </code>
 *
 * Backend parameters:<pre>
 * server	= Machine where you want to change the password (Required)
 * bin		= Full pathname of the pspasswd.exe program (Required)
 * admusr	= User with administrative privileges (Required)
 * admpwd	= Password of the administrative user (Required)
 * domain	= Windows domain name (Optional)
 * </pre>
 *
 * For example: Passing a NT4 PDC server name to the server parameter
 * means you can change the user's password on that NT4 Domain.
 *
 * Special thanks to Mark Russinovich (mark@sysinternals.com) for the
 * tool and helping me solve some questions about it.
