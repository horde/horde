==================
 Upgrading Passwd
==================

:Contact:       sork@lists.horde.org


These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Passwd versions.

After updating to a newer Passwd version, you **always** need to update
configurations and database schemes. Log in as an administrator, go to
Administration => Configuration and update anything that's highlighted as
outdated.


Upgrading Passwd from 3.0 to 3.1
================================


Application Hooks
-----------------

All hooks that are specific to Passwd have been moved from the
``horde/config/hooks.php`` file. Move your existing Passwd Hooks from there to
``passwd/config/hooks.php``.


New Hook Parameters
-------------------

The _passwd_hook_username hook is now passed an additional parameter, the
Passwd_Driver_* object for the backend that you are changing the password on.
This allows Passwd to support users being able to change passwords on multiple
backends even when the different backends may have different requirements for
the username (such as one requiring'user@example.com' while another only
requiring 'user'). Additionally, the Passwd_Driver_composite driver also
supports this functionality by checking for the existence of a parameter
called 'be_username' in each of it's sub-drivers. If this parameter is
present, its value overrides any other value of $userid it is passed. If you
wish to use this functionality of the composite driver, look at the example
_passwd_hook_username function in horde/config/hooks.php.dist.
