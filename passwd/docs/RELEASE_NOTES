The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Passwd Horde
password changing application version H4 (4.0.0).

Passwd provides support for changing passwords via the horde authentication or
various backends.

This version of passwd supports horde authentication driver (if it supports 
changing passwords), sql and ldap backends as well as composite backends.

The following additional password backends have been given little attention 
and have not been tested at all:

Unix expect scripts, the Unix smbpasswd command for SMB/CIFS passwords,
Kolab, ADSI, Pine, Serv-U FTP, VMailMgr, vpopmail.

The major changes compared to Passwd version H3 (3.1.2) are:
    * Conversion to Horde 4.
    * added Horde Authentication as backend
