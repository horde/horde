- There should be more error checking for various things, in particular sanity
  checking of the form variables passed in.

- Document issues of poppassd/ldap/smbpasswd perhaps allowing weak passwords
  or otherwise getting around passwd restrictions.  Document the password
  length and strength tests, and how bad they really are.  We could
  investigate using cracklib calls, since it is supported by php, but that
  would require cracklib to be installed on the system and in PHP.

- Need to clean up the ldapd code still.  A work in progress.  Maybe pass the
  password field "userPassword" as a config item so people can name it
  differently if needed?

- The exim sql driver defines a lot of stuff in conf.php that should already
  be defined in Horde/IMP's configs.  We should probably reuse the Horde/IMP
  stuff rather than duplicating the configuration???

- Display the password policy to the user that he knows how the password
  should look like (Request #2304).
