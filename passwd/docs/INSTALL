This document contains instructions for installing the Passwd Password
Changing Application.

For information on the capabilities and features of Passwd, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Passwd distribution.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Passwd **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Passwd runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Passwd.

   .. Important:: Passwd 5.0 requires version 5.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Passwd. Many of Passwd's prerequisites are also
                  Horde prerequisites. Additionally, many of Passwd's optional
                  features are configured via the Horde install.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/apps/horde

2. The following PHP capabilities, depending on the drivers you want use:

   a. Character Type support ``--enable-ctype``

   b. LDAP support ``--with-ldap`` [OPTIONAL]

      LDAP support is required for the kolab, ldap, and smbldap drivers.

   c. Hash support [OPTIONAL]

      Hash support is necessary for the smbldap driver.  See `LDAP
      Implementation Information`_ for details.

   d. Mcrypt support ``--with-mcrypt`` [OPTIONAL]

      Mcrypt support is necessary for the smbldap driver.  See `LDAP
      Implementation Information`_ for details.

   e. SOAP support ``--enable-soap`` [OPTIONAL]

      SOAP support is necessary for the soap driver.

3. The following PEAR modules:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PEAR modules)

   .. Important:: If you are going to install Passwd the recommended way,
                  i.e. using the PEAR installer, you can skip the remainder of
                  this section. Installing Passwd through PEAR will
                  automatically download and install all required PEAR modules.

   a. Crypt_CHAP [OPTIONAL]

      Passwd uses this package to encrypt passwords for the smbldap driver.

The following items might be required, depending on the drivers you want to
use:

1. A poppassd server installed, running, and working on a system.

2. An LDAP server installed, running, and working for authentication.

3. A working smbpasswd program on the web server.  It can access a remote
   server, but the smbpasswd binary must be installed on the local system.

4. A working SQL authentication system.

5. Expect installed, and access to telnet or ssh to the machine where
   passwords are stored/set (could be localhost).

6. A SOAP service endpoint.


Installing Passwd
===================

The **RECOMMENDED** way to install Passwd is using the PEAR installer.
Alternatively, if you want to run the latest development code or get the
latest not yet released fixes, you can install Passwd from Git.

Installing with PEAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First follow the instructions in `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ to prepare a PEAR
environment for Horde and install the Horde Framework.

When installing Passwd through PEAR now, the installer will automatically
install any dependencies of Passwd too. If you want to install Passwd with all
optional dependencies, but without the binary PECL packages that need to be
compiled, specify both the ``-a`` and the ``-B`` flag::

   pear install -a -B horde/passwd

By default, only the required dependencies will be installed::

   pear install horde/passwd

If you want to install Passwd even with all binary dependencies, you need to
remove the ``-B`` flag. Please note that this might also try to install PHP
extensions through PECL that might need further configuration or activation in
your PHP configuration::

   pear install -a horde/passwd

Installing from Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See http://www.horde.org/source/git.php


Configuring Passwd
====================

1. Configuring Passwd

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Passwd.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``Password`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Password Configuration`` to generate the
   ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to
   the Passwd configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write
   the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the
   other methods to create the configuration file ``passwd/config/conf.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the other configuration files in
   the ``config/`` directory can be found in each file. You may create
   ``*.local.php`` versions of these files if you wish to customize Passwd's
   appearance and behavior. See the header of the configuration files for
   details and examples. The defaults will be correct for most sites.

2. Testing Passwd

   Once you have configured Passwd, bring up the included test page in your
   Web browser to ensure that all necessary prerequisites have been met.  See
   the `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ document for further details on Horde test
   scripts.  If you installed Passwd as described above, the URL to the test
   page would be::

      http://your-server/horde/test.php?app=passwd


Security considerations
=======================

.. Note:: Some drivers like poppassd always use clear text password
          transmissions.  Others may also use clear text passwords (e.g. the
          expect script driver using telnet rather than ssh).  This can be
          considered somewhat safe if the server is on the same machine, there
          are no user interactive logins allowed on that machine, and the
          connection uses the loopback (localhost) interface.  It is up to the
          administrator to evaluate the security implications of using this
          module, and to understand the security implications of how their
          server and this module is configured.

.. Note:: Setting this module to allow guest access might also be considered a
          security risk.  By default, guest access is disabled.  It is up to
          the administrator to evaluate the security implications of using
          this module with guest access if they choose to do so.

LDAP Implementation Information
===============================

The module includes support for changing LDAP stored passwords.

LDAP can store passwords in multiple ways, namely:

a. Plain text passwords
b. SHA encrypted passwords
c. SSHA encrypted passwords
d. Crypt encrypted passwords
e. MD5 encrypted passwords (using base64 encoding - md5-base64)
f. SMD5 encrypted passwords

The smbldap extension require the php hash and mcrypt extensions.  To enable
these you must compile php with ``--with-mcrypt[=DIR]`` and **without** the
``--disable-hash`` parameters. ``DIR`` is the mcrypt install directory.

Crypt cannot handle passwords longer than eight characters (it accepts them
but truncates them at 8 characters).  If you want to use longer passwords, you
may use SHA.

The user must be able to authenticate to the LDAP directory and change his own
password now (we no longer do root access to LDAP).  This assumes that the
LDAP administrator has allowed everyone to write their own password, something
like::

   access to attribute=userPassword
          by self write
          by anonymous auth
          by * none


SQL Implementation Information
==============================

The module includes support for changing passwords stored in a SQL database.
The SQL driver is similar to the LDAP driver except that it also supports MD5
encryption using hex encoding (md5-hex).  If you created your passwords using
the PHP md5() function then use md5-hex.


Smbpasswd Implementation Information
====================================

To use this module, you must pass the address of your Samba domain controller
on which to change the password.  This can be "localhost" for the server that
Horde runs on.  The remote system name may be passed as the NETBIOS name, the
DNS name, or the IP address of the SMB/CIFS server to connect to.  The
username is run through ``escapeshellcmd()``, so any usernames with strange
characters ($, &, etc) may not work.  I'm not sure if any of these are even
valid for SMB/CIFS authentication, but if so, they may not work in this
module.

.. Note:: If changing a Windows NT Domain password the remote machine
          specified must be the Primary Domain Controller for the domain
          (Backup Domain Controllers only have a read-only copy of the user
          account database and will not allow the password change).

Since smbpasswd works in client-server mode communicating with a local smbd
for a non-root user, the smbd daemon must be running for this to work.  A
common problem is to add a restriction to the hosts that may access the smbd
running on the local machine by specifying a allow hosts or deny hosts entry
in the ``smb.conf`` file and neglecting to allow "localhost" access to the
smbd.

In addition, the smbpasswd command is only useful if Samba has been set up to
use encrypted passwords.


Expect Script Information
=========================

This code allows users to change their passwords via an expect script.  The
module requires the expect program and a telnet or ssh program.  You may need
to change some of the expect patterns in ``passwd-expect`` such as the
``badpassword_string`` or ``success_string`` (as only two examples).

For security reasons, it is generally suggested to use ssh rather than telnet
for the transport, if possible.


Expect PECL Information
=======================

This code allows users to change their passwords via the PHP PECL expect
extension. It requires the PECL expect extension and a ssh program.

You can find the extension on http://pecl.php.net/package/expect
