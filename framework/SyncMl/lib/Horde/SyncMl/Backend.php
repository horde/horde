/**
 * A SyncML Backend provides the interface between the SyncML protocol and an
 * actual calendar or address book application. This "actual application" is
 * called the "data store" in this description.
 *
 * The backend provides the following groups of functions:
 *
 * 1) Access to the datastore
 *    Reading, adding, replacing and deleting of entries.  Also retrieve
 *    information about changes in data store.  This is done via the
 *    retrieveEntry(), addEntry(), replaceEntry(), deleteEntry() and
 *    getServerChanges() methods.
 *
 * 2) User management functions
 *    This is the checkAuthentication() method to verify that a given user
 *    password combination is allowed to access the backend data store, and
 *    the setUser() method which does a "login" to the backend data store if
 *    required by the type of backend data store. Please note that the
 *    password is only transferred once in a sync session, so when handling
 *    the subsequent packets messages, the user may need to be "logged in"
 *    without a password. (Or the session management keeps the user "logged
 *    in").
 *
 * 3) Maintainig the client ID <-> server ID map
 *    The SyncML protocol does not require clients and servers to use the same
 *    primary keys for the data entries. So a map has to be in place to
 *    convert between client primary keys (called cuid's here) and server
 *    primary keys (called suid's). It's up to the server to maintain this
 *    map.  Method for this is createUidMap().
 *
 * 4) Sync anchor handling
 *    After a successful initial sync, the client and server sync timestamps
 *    are stored. This allows to perform subsequent syncs as delta syncs,
 *    where only new changes are replicated. Servers as well as clients need
 *    to be able to store two sync anchors (the client's and the server's) for
 *    a sync. Methods for this are readSyncAnchors() and writeSyncAnchors().
 *
 * 5) Test supporting functions
 *    The SyncML module comes with its own testing framework. All you need to
 *    do is implement the two methods testSetup() and testTearDown() and you
 *    are able to test your backend with all the test cases that are part of
 *    the module.
 *
 * 6) Miscellaneous functions
 *    This involves session handling (sessionStart() and sessionClose()),
 *    logging (logMessage() and logFile()), timestamp creation
 *    (getCurrentTimeStamp()), charset handling (getCharset(), setCharset())
 *    and database identification (isValidDatabaseURI()). For all of these
 *    functions, a default implementation is provided in Horde_SyncMl_Backend.
 *
 * If you want to create a backend for your own appliction, you can either
 * derive from Horde_SyncMl_Backend and implement everything in groups 1 to 5
 * or you derive from Horde_SyncMl_Backend_Sql which implements an example
 * backend based on direct database access using the PEAR MDB2 package. In this
 * case you only need to implement groups 1 to 3 and can use the implementation
 * from Horde_SyncMl_Backend_Sql as a guideline for these functions.
 *
 * Key Concepts
 * ------------
 * In order to successfully create a backend, some understanding of a few key
 * concepts in SyncML and the Horde_SyncMl package are certainly helpful.  So
 * here's some stuff that should make some issues clear (or at lest less
 * obfuscated):
 *
 * 1) DatabaseURIs and Databases
 *    The SyncML protocol itself is completly independant from the data that
 *    is replicated. Normally the data are calendar or address book entries
 *    but it may really be anything from browser bookmarks to comeplete
 *    database tables. An ID (string name) of the database you want to
 *    actually replicate has to be configured in the client. Typically that's
 *    something like 'calendar' or 'tasks'. Client and server must agree on
 *    these names.  In addition this string may be used to provide additional
 *    arguments.  These are provided in a HTTP GET query style: like
 *    tasks?ignorecompletedtasks to replicate only pending tasks. Such a "sync
 *    identifier" is called a DatabaseURI and is really a database name plus
 *    some additional options.
 *    The Horde_SyncMl package completly ignores these options and simply passes
 *    them on to the backend. It's up to the backend to decide what to do with
 *    them. However when dealing with the internal maps (cuid<->suid and sync
 *    anchors), it's most likely to use the database name only rather than the
 *    full databaseURI. The map information saying that server entry
 *    20070101203040xxa@mypc.org has id 768 in the client device is valid for
 *    the database "tasks", not for "tasks?somesillyoptions". So what you
 *    normally do is calling some kind of <code>$database =
 *    $this->normalize($databaseURI)</cod> in every backend method that deals
 *    with databaseURIs and use $database afterwards. However actual usage of
 *    options is up to the backend implementation. SyncML works fine without.
 *
 * 2) Suid and Guid mapping
 *    This is the mapping of client IDs to server IDs and vice versa.  Please
 *    note that this map is per user and per client device: the server entry
 *    20070101203040xxa@mypc.org may have ID 720 in your PDA and AA10FC3A in
 *    your mobile phone.
 *
 * 3) Sync Anchors
 *    @todo describe sync anchors
 *    Have a look at the SyncML spec
 *    http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/affiliates/syncml/syncmlindex.html
 *    to find out more.
 *
 * 4) Changes and Timestamps
 *    @todo description of Changes and Timestamps, "mirroring effect"
 *    This is real tricky stuff.
 *    First it's important to know, that the SyncML protocol requires the
 *    ending timestamp of the sync timeframe to be exchanged _before_ the
 *    actual syncing starts. So all changes made during a sync have timestamps
 *    that are in the timeframe for the next upcoming sync.  Data exchange in
 *    a sync session works in two steps: 1st) the clients sends its changes to
 *    the server, 2nd) the server sends its changes to the client.
 *    So when in step 2, the backend datastore API is called with a request
 *    like "give me all changes in the server since the last sync".  Thus you
 *    also get the changes induced by the client in step 1 as well.  You have
 *    to somehow "tag" them to avoid echoing (and thus duplicating) them back
 *    to the client. Simply storing the guids in the session is not
 *    sufficient: the changes are made _after_ the end timestamp (see 1) of
 *    the current sync so you'll dupe them in the next sync.
 *    The current implementation deals with this as follows: whenever a client
 *    induced change is done in the backend, the timestamp for this change is
 *    stored in the cuid<->suid map in an additional field. That's the perfect
 *    place as the tagging needs to be done "per client device": when an add
 *    is received from the PDA it must not be sent back as an add to this
 *    device, but to mobile phone it must be sent.
 *    This is sorted out during the getServerChanges() process: if a server
 *    change has a timestamp that's the same as in the guid<->suid map, it
 *    came from the client and must not be added to the list of changes to be
 *    sent to this client.
 *    See the description of Horde_SyncMl_Backend_Sql::_getChangeTS() for some
 *    more information.
 *
 * 5) Messages and Packages
 *    A message is a single HTTP Request. A package is single "logical
 *    message", a sync step. Normally the two coincide. However due to message
 *    size restrictions one package may be transferred in multiple messages
 *    (HTTP requests).
 *
 * 7) Server mode, client mode and test mode
 *    Per default, a backend is used for an SyncML server. Regarding the
 *    SyncML protocol, the working of client and server is similar, except
 *    that
 *    a) the client initiates the sync requests and the server respons to them,
 *       and
 *    b) the server must maintain the client id<->server id map.
 *
 *    Currently the Horde_SyncMl package is designed to create servers. But
 *    is's an obvious (and straightforward) extension to do it for clients as
 *    well.  And as a client has actually less work to do than a server, the
 *    backend should work for servers _and_ clients. During the sessionStart(),
 *    the backend gets a parameter to let it know whether it's in client or
 *    server mode (or test, see below). When in client mode, it should behave
 *    slightly different:
 *    a) the client doesn't do suid<->cuid mapping, so all invokations to the
 *       map creation method createUidMap().
 *    b) the client has only client ids, no server ids. So all arguments are
 *       considered cuids even when named suid. See the Horde_SyncMl_Backend_Sql
 *       implementation, it's actually not that difficult.
 *
 *    Finally there's the test mode. The test cases consist of replaying
 *    pre-recorded sessions. For that to work, the test script must "simulate"
 *    user entries in the server data store. To do so, it creates a backend in
 *    test mode. This behaves similar to a client: when an server entry is
 *    created (modified) using addEntry() (replaceEntry()), no map entry must
 *    be done.
 *    The test backend uses also the two methods testSetup() and testTearDown()
 *    to create a clean (empty) enviroment for the test user "syncmltest".  See
 *    the Horde_SyncMl_Backend_Sql implementation for details.
