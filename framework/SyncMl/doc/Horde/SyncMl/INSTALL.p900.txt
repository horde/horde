How to get SyncML working with your P800/P900:
[[somebody with access to other phones might add instructions
for these as well. Thanks]]

Start "Remote Synchronisation" from you phones app launcher:


1)Select edit/settings and put in the following:

"Server" tab:
server address: http://yourserver.com/horde/rpc.php
user name: your horde user name
password: your horde user password

"Protocol" tab:
Needs not to be filled in. Unless you have your web-server
configured to require HTTP Authentification.


2) Configure sync types:

Start with Calendar/Tasks:

	check "activate"
	name can be anything
	server database: must be "calendar"

For Jotter the server database name is "notes".

However you should start with activating one type only.

3) Hit Sync, wait and hope.

Now Synchronoisation should take place. During the first sync
a set union of the client's and server's data sets are created.
Further Sync runs should only transfer the changes since last
time.


If it's not working:

make sure the /tmp/sync directory exists and is writeable by your
webserver (user might be wwwrun). Try to Sync once more and check
the input/output in this directory.
Maybe change your php.ini settings so php logs ERROR messages and
NOTICEs in a file as well. Check this file. Your phone gets
confused when the XML is cluttered with stuff like

"PHP Notice:  Undefined index:  body in /blah/blub.php on line 256"

Consult sync@lists.horde.org and the syncml.org protocol specification.
