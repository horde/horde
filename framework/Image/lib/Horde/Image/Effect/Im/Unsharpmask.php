     * Valid parameters:
     *
     *  (float)radius - Thickness of the sharpened edge. Should be greater then
     *                  sigma (or 0, and imagick will attempt to auto choose).
     *                  In general, radius should be roughly output dpi / 150.
     *                  So for display purposes a radius of 0.5 is suggested.
     *
     *  (float)amount - Amount of the difference between original and the
     *                  blur image that gets added back to the original. Can be
     *                  thought of as the "strength" of the effect. Too high
     *                  may cause blocking of shadows and highlights. Given
     *                  a decimal value indicating percentage, e.g. 1.2 = 120%
     *
     *  (float)threshold - Determines how large the brightness delta between
     *                     adjacent pixels needs to be to sharpen the edge.
     *                     Larger values == less sharpening. Useful for
     *                     preventing noisy images from being oversharpened.
     *
     *  (integer)channel - Which channel to apply the sharpening to.
     *
