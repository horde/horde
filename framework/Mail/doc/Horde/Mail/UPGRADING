This lists the API changes between minor releases of the package.


Upgrading To 1.1.0
==================

New Objects
-----------

Horde_Mail_Rfc822::parseAddressList() now returns an array of
Horde_Mail_Rfc822_Address objects (and Horde_Mail_Rfc822_Group objects, if
nest_groups is true).

These objects are backward compatible with the former array representation.
They also include additional functionality.

    Anything other than accessing these properties is a new feature available
    only since 1.1.0:

    - adl
    - comment
    - host
    - mailbox
    - personal

  - Horde_Mail_Rfc822_Group

    Anything other than accessing these properties is a new feature available
    only since 1.1.0:

    - addresses
    - groupname
