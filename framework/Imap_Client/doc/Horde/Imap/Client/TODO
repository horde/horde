TODO for 2.0
============

  - Horde_Imap_Client_Base#currentMailbox()

      The 'mailbox' return value should always be returned as a
      Horde_Imap_Client_Mailbox object.

  - Horde_Imap_Client_Base#fetch()

      Move 'vanished' parameter to a separate method.  It does not return
      true data objects like the other options - it should instead return a
      list of UIDs only - so it doesn't really fit in a fetch() call, even
      though the underlying IMAP command used is FETCH.

      Remove fetch_vanished_res temporary variable in Socket.php.

  - Horde_Imap_Client_Base#getNamespaces()

      The array keys, 'name' key, and 'translation' key in the return array
      should return a UTF-8 string, not UTF7-IMAP.

  - Horde_Imap_Client_Base#listMailboxes()

      Return array keys should be UTF-8 strings, not UTF7-IMAP.

      The 'mailbox' return value should always be returned as a
      Horde_Imap_Client_Mailbox object.

  - Horde_Imap_Client_Base#statusMultiple()

      The return array keys should be returned in UTF-8, not UTF7-IMAP.

  - Horde_Imap_Client_Data_Envelope
      The *_decoded properties should be removed.  The addresses should be
      stored MIME decoded within the Address objects - MIME [en|de]coding
      should be done exclusively in there.

  - Horde_Imap_Client_Exception

      Remove deprecated constants.

  - Horde_Imap_Client#factory()

      Remove Cclient mappings.
