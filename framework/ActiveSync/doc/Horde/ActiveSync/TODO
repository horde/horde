TODO for 2.0
============

- Monolithic state handling?
  Need to be able to tell PING state about SYNC state's synckey to more
  efficiently know the proper last_syncts values. So, the collection's PING
  state will *always* be loaded (for both SYNC and PING requests) and we can
  save the current SYNC syncKey into the colletion's PING state. NOTE: This
  might be unneccessary once we implement EAS 12.0 or 12.1

- Figure out how to better separate the imap handling classes from Core. If
  we want Horde_ActiveSync to be friendly to reuse outside of Horde, we need
  to provide a better out-of-the-box solution for connecting to IMAP. We should
  provide a base/abstract IMAP adapter in Horde_ActiveSync and an implementation
  for Horde_Imap_Client. The problem is, at the moment, that we rely on the mail
  API (i.e. IMP) for obtaining the folder list. Once we can implement that
  entirely within Horde_ActiveSync's IMAP adapter we can do this.
