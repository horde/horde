- After kronolith gets support for different organizer/owner fields, must
  properly set the organizer for meeting responses. Currently, the event
  created from a meeting response does not contain the organizer of the original
  event. So when the event is sync'd back to the device, it allows the user
  to cancel the event and send updates to all attendees. Also, it will then be
  possible to automatically add responses to the kronolith event from the
  incoming activesync response message.
