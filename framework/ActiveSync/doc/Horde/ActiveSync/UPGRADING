This lists the API changes between releases of the package.


Upgrading to 2.0
================

Horde_ActiveSync_State_File was removed.

  - Horde_ActiveSync_Driver

    - __construct()

      No longer plan on accepting multiple state objects. Rename the
      'state_basic' parameter to 'state'. This should still contain a
      Horde_ActiveSync_State_* object.

    - getMessageList()

      This deprecated method has been removed, getServerChanges() should be used
      instead.

    - getServerChanges()

      Now requires a Horde_ActiveSync_Folder_Base object as the first parameter.

    - alterPingChanges()

      This deprecated method has been removed.

    - truncate()

      This method has been removed.

    - getSyncObject()

      This method has been removed. The Sync object is now built by the request
      object itself. See Horde_ActiveSync_Request_Base#_getSyncObject.

  - Horde_ActiveSync_State_History

    - Renamed to Horde_ActiveSync_State_Sql

    - SQL table names are no longer configurable.

    - Internal state data is now stored as serialized Horde_ActiveSync_Folder_*
      objects.

    - All code related to PING state has been removed. PING state is combined
      with the new syncCache.
