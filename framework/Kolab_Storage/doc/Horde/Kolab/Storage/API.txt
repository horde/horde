Kolab_Storage structure and API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
============

Kolab_Storage is a PHP library that provides access to the user data
stored in a Kolab Server backend. The data is usually accessed via
IMAP which is not cheap. Hence the primary purpose of the library is
to reduce the IMAP traffic to a minimal amount. This is achieved by
caching the parsed Kolab groupware data after retrieving it from the
IMAP account and only updating the cache incrementally whenever
possible.


Core Elements
=============

The library divides the data access into three conceptual elements:

 - The "List"
 - The "Folder"
 - The "Data"


1. Rationale

First and foremost this structure intends to provide simple Kolab data
access for the developer using the API. In addition this structure
does at least to some degree follow structures that one would choose
when representing the data available in the Kolab server backend in a
relational database. But it also reflects specific constraints imposed
by the IMAP protocol.

The following sections will - among other things
- try to highlight the reasons for the specific boundaries between the
different elements.


2. Querying

Each of the elements mentioned above is able to handle a defined set
of data. While handling this information efficiently is important it
is often even more important to allow quick access ("queries") into
the data set. How these queries are made quick is left to the
implementation but the library strives to clearly separate data
management and querying the data to allow optimizing both
independantly.

Wherever applicable the following sections will also highlight the
most common queries.


3. Caching

It was initially mentioned that caching is a central aspect of the
library. It is however equally important to point out that caching is
totally irrelevant to the API itself. The three elements mentioned
above always provide the same set of functions to the
consumer. Whether the data access is cached in between or not. This
design choice allows invisible changes to the actual caching technique
up to a complete swapping of different caching approaches. There are
other benefits as well when it comes to logging and time series
measurements.

The following sections will - if applicable - indicate what needs to
be done on the IMAP level in order to synchronize the server backend
with the cache. This will focus on keeping the IMAP traffic to a
minimum.


"List"
------

The list handler is concerned with the IMAP folder list visible for a
user. It is handles folder names, types, and ownership. While folders
typically have many other attributes only this small selection has
been chosen to be dealt with by the list handler.

The primary reason for this is the fact that folder names and folder
types can each be listed using just a single IMAP
statement. Additional folder attributes often need to be read using an
IMAP statment *per folder*. In addition the other attributes are less
frequently used. Folder attributes not represented by the "List" are
represented by the "Folder" element.


1. Data

The managed data consists only of the folder names and the folder type
annotation ('/shared/vendor/kolab/folder-type'). There are several
additional information that can be derived from these basic
attributes:

 - Namespace of the folder ('personal', 'other', 'shared')
 - Owner of the folder (self, other user, or anonymous)
 - Folder type ('event', 'task', 'note', 'contact', 'journal', ...)
 - Default setting (e.g. the "default" calendar of a user)

These are however a topic for the queries based on the list.

For information about namespace/ownership handling you should refer to
the "Folder Namespace" section within "Other Elements" below.

Core methods of the list handler:

    /**
     * Returns the list of folders visible to the current user.
     *
     * @return array The list of folders, represented as strings.
     */
    public function listFolders();

    /**
     * Returns the folder type annotation as associative array.
     *
     * @return array The list folder types with the folder names as key and the
     *               folder type as values.
     */
    public function listFolderTypes();


2. Queries

A number of relevant queries can be based on this relatively small dataset:

 - List all folders with their folder type
 - List all folders of a specified folder type
 - Identify the default folder of a specific folder type
 - Identify the default folder of another user (again given a specific folder type)

Core methods of the basic list query:

    /**
     * Returns the folder types as associative array.
     *
     * @return array The list folder types with the folder names as key and the
     *               type as values.
     */
    public function listTypes();

    /**
     * List all folders of a specific type.
     *
     * @param string $type The folder type the listing should be limited to.
     *
     * @return array The list of folders.
     */
    public function listByType($type);

    /**
     * Get the default folder for a certain type.
     *
     * @param string $type The type of the share/folder.
     *
     * @return string|boolean The name of the default folder, false if there is no default.
     */
    public function getDefault($type);

    /**
     * Get the default folder for a certain type from a different owner.
     *
     * @param string $owner The folder owner.
     * @param string $type  The type of the share/folder.
     *
     * @return string|boolean The name of the default folder, false if there is no default.
     */
    public function getForeignDefault($owner, $type);


3. Synchronization

In order to synchronize the cache with the server backend two IMAP commands are needed:

 A0002 LIST "" "*"
 A0003 GETANNOTATION "*" ("/vendor/kolab/folder-type") ("value.shared")

The second command is not required in case the folder list did not
change at all. If only one or very few folders changed in the folder
list it might make sense to call "GETANNOTATION" per folder. This
could be quicker if the user has access to many folders. 


4. Remarks

 i.  The Kolab specific patch to the c-client library that implements
     the "GETANNOTATION" command is unable to deal with the return
     value of a 'GETANNOTATION "*"' call. Thus it is forced to deal
     with the folder type annotation one by one. This introduces
     significant problems when a user has many folders. At the current
     state the PHP IMAP extension cannot be recommend for such
     situations. None of the other supported IMAP drivers have this
     specific problem. They all support a multi-folder response.

 ii. Currently the folder STATUS is also checked on a per-folder
     basis. One might consider doing this for the complete folder list
     as well. This is however not supported by the Kolab server at the
     moment. And the number of folders checked for their status should
     also always be significantly smaller than the complete folder
     list.

Other Elements
==============

The Kolab_Storage library also provides a number of supporting
elements that are less visible within the API. Some of them should be
mentioned though to highlight important features of the library.


Driver
------

Currently there are five backend drivers available. Nearly all of them
are IMAP based. In theory it would be possible to provide drivers that
use alternative means to read and write the groupware data. One could
imagine a file based driver that could be used for test purposes. So
far the need for such experiments has not arisen though.

The currently supported drivers:

 - "Cclient":

   based on the PHP IMAP extension (which uses the c-client library)

 - "Imap":

   based on the Horde_Imap_Client library (a pure PHP implementation
   for IMAP access)

 - "Rcube":

   based on the roundcube IMAP library (a pure PHP implementation for
   IMAP access)

 - "Pear":

   based on the PEAR-Net_IMAP library (a pure PHP implementation for
   IMAP access)

 - "Mock":

   a mock implementation that handles the data access purely in
   memory. This is being used for testing purposes.


Folder Namespace
----------------

The newer variants of the Kolab_Storage library are capable of using
the IMAP namespace information provided by servers with the NAMESPACE
capability.

Older versions were using hardcoded namespace information and strings
such as "INBOX", "user/", "shared." were directly used in the
code. While this works fine for the Kolab server it is hardly portable
to many other IMAP setups.
