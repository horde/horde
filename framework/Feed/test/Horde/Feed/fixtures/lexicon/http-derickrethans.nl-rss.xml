  <title>Friday afternoon toying: eZ Components as phar</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/friday_afternoon_toying_ez_components_as_phar.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
PHP 5.3 will have a new cool feature: &lt;a href="http://php.net/phar"&gt;phar&lt;/a&gt;. A phar is to PHP what a jar is to
Java. I spent a little time to see how easy it would be to make our
latest &lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org"&gt;eZ Components&lt;/a&gt; release
into a workable phar.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First of all, a phar can be build from a directory structure with a few
functions only:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?php 
$phar = new Phar(
    'ezcomponents-2008.1.phar', 0,
    'ezcomponents-2008.1.phar' );
$phar-&amp;gt;buildFromDirectory(
    __DIR__ . '/ezcomponents-2008.1',
    '/\.php$/');
$phar-&amp;gt;compressFiles( Phar::GZ );
$phar-&amp;gt;stopBuffering();
?&amp;gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This build script will create a phar from the directory contents in
"ezcomponents-2008.1", but only include the PHP files (See
http://php.net/phar.buildfromdirectory). We compress all the files and
with &lt;a href="http://php.net/phar.stopbuffering"&gt;stopBuffering&lt;/a&gt;we
write the file to disk. With the following code, we can now use the phar
in our application:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
require 'ezcomponents-2008.1.phar';

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is also possible to run a bit of code when including the phar. You do
this, by adding a stub to the phar. To do so, we include the following
code just before the compressFiles() call:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$stub = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;ENDSTUB
&amp;lt;?php
Phar::mapPhar( 'ezcomponents-2008.1.phar' );
require 'phar://ezcomponents-2008.1.phar/Base/src/base.php';
spl_autoload_register( array( 'ezcBase', 'autoload' ) );
__HALT_COMPILER();
ENDSTUB;
$phar-&amp;gt;setStub( $stub );

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After we re-create the phar with "php -dphar.readonly=0
build.php". The new phar once required will now setup the autoload
mechanism of the eZ Components. The following script demonstrates that
it actually works:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?php
require 'ezcomponents-2008.1.phar';
$f = ezcFeed::parse( 'http://derickrethans.nl/rss.xml' );
foreach ( $f-&amp;gt;item as $item )
{
    echo $item-&amp;gt;title, &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;;
}
?&amp;gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Conclusion: phar is cool!

  <title>eZ Components 2008.2 roadmap</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/ez_components_20082_roadmap.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org/"&gt;&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/ezc-logo.png' align='' alt=''/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We've created a roadmap for the upcoming &lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org"&gt;eZ Components&lt;/a&gt; (2008.2) release. In
this release our main focus is to add MVC support. Where most frameworks
dedicate a specific router, controller and view, the MVC implementation
in eZ Components will only consist of very loosely based parts. For each
of the specific parts of MVC we will provide one or more default
implementations, as well as detailed information on how to write your
own implementations of a Model, View and Controller. Of course most of
those implementations will be done through Tie-in components. At the
moment we're creating a requirements and design specification. If you're
interested in participating in this discussion, please drop by on our
&lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org/support/mailinglist"&gt;mailinglist&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Besides this main focus, we will also enhance some of the critical
components that the upcoming version of eZ Publish will require. Please
see the &lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org/overview/roadmap"&gt; full
roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/ezc-logo.png' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last Thursday, during the &lt;a href="http://conference.ez.no/"&gt;Open
Nordic Conference 2008&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ Systems&lt;/a&gt;
handed out its annual awards again. For the &lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org"&gt;eZ Components&lt;/a&gt; award, there were
four nominees, which are all recognised for their support of the eZ
Components project.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The nominees were Stefan Marr and Falko Menge: for the work on
the upcoming Extended Reflection component, James Pic: for the
work on the upcoming MVC additions, Andreas Schamberger: for
contributions to the &lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org/docs/api/latest/introduction_Template.html#translations"&gt;Template
and Translation tie-in&lt;/a&gt; functionality, and Freddie
Witherden: for the contribution of SVG font support in the &lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org/s/Graph"&gt;Graph&lt;/a&gt; component.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year's eZ Components award has been awarded to James Pic ,
congratulations!

  <title>PHP Vikinger 2008 Wrap-up</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/php_vikinger_2008_wrapup.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
PHP Vikinger is over again. With about 35 attendees, I would think it
was a great success. After opening the event, we figured out which
topics people were interested in. After voting for the topics, we came
up with a nice couple of topics. First we had a little discussion on QA
and Testing, which Thomas Nuninnger moderated. I include my (raw) notes
from this:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/"&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; takes a long time
to run tests, so Thomas only uses it for front end only, whereas &lt;a href="http://phpunit.de"&gt;phpunit&lt;/a&gt; is used for as much as possible
backend code. Selenium apparently has some functionality for parallizing
( &lt;a href="http://selenium-grid.openqa.org/"&gt;selenium grid&lt;/a&gt;), but
there are some issues as well as you can not tell it to run specific
tests parallel. &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/webdriver/"&gt;WebDriver&lt;/a&gt; does exactly
the same, except for running it in the same browser. But it's going away
from actually using a real browser... which sorta defeats the point of
Selenium. Thomas also mentions that sometimes a fixed value as recorded
by the IDE is not good... but you can "fix" that yourself in
the PHPUnit tests that Selenium can export. The IDE is getting better
BTW. &lt;a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/"&gt;CruiseControl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.phpundercontrol.org/"&gt;phpUnderControl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://phing.info/"&gt;phing&lt;/a&gt; (phing is not gnu make) - a port
of &lt;a href="http://ant.apache.org/"&gt;Ant&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After this, we had a discussion about the deployment of web
applications, where we discussed some different approaches such as
"svn check-out", but also tools for doing so such as &lt;a href="http://www.capify.org/"&gt;Capistrano&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sebastian then explained a little bit about the &lt;a href="http://php.net/class"&gt;PHP Object Model&lt;/a&gt;. We also tried to
figure out a strange profiling issue in one of Zoë Slattery's
applications with &lt;a href="http://xdebug.org"&gt;Xdebug&lt;/a&gt;, but we
could not manage to figure out what it was just yet. The last talk
before lunch was from Kore Nordmann about &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/"&gt;CouchDb&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the pizza lunch provided by Klosterøya, we continued with
presentations on &lt;a href="http://www.projectzero.org/"&gt;Project
Zero&lt;/a&gt;, by Ant Philips of IBM; the new lexer in PHP by Scott
MacVicar and a talk by Sebastian Bergmann on the &lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org/s/Workflow"&gt;eZ Components' Workflow&lt;/a&gt;
component. The last talk of the day was by Tobias Schlitt on &lt;a href="http://ezcomponents.org/s/Database"&gt;database abstraction with eZ
Components&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I will put the slides online at the &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org"&gt;PHP Vikinger&lt;/a&gt; website once I receive
all of them.

  <title>Namespaces in PHP</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/namespaces_in_php.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
During Stefan Priebsch' session at the &lt;a href="http://phpconference.nl"&gt;Dutch PHP Conference&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://phpconference.nl/schedule/php6"&gt;PHP 5.3 and PHP 6 - A look
ahead&lt;/a&gt; a discussion popped up about PHP's namespace support. One of
the things that came up is the conflicts that can arise with internal
classes.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Take for example this code:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?php
use PEAR::Date::Interval as Interval;
?&amp;gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In PHP 5.3 this would alias the class Interval in the namespace
PEAR::Date to the class Interval. For now, this code would work just
fine. However, if PHP would introduce a class "Interval" at
some point in the future (and PHP can do this as it &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/userlandnaming.rules.php"&gt;owns the
global namespace&lt;/a&gt;) then the above code would suddenly stop working.
So in order to use namespaces properly, you always need to have at least
two elements left, like:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?php
use PEAR::Date as pd;
$interval = new pd::Interval;
?&amp;gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You need to make sure of course that the short name that you pick is
something that does not sound to much like a class name otherwise you'll
have exactly the same issue. It's not very likely that PHP will
introduce a class pd though.
		&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Detecting Timezone By IP</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/detecting_timezone_by_ip.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
Through &lt;a href="http://planet-php.org"&gt;Planet PHP&lt;/a&gt; I found an
article on &lt;a href="http://torrentialwebdev.com/blog/archives/152-Pre-populating-forms-with-the-timezone.html"&gt;Pre-populating
forms with the timezone&lt;/a&gt;. I'd normally add a comment instead, but
the comment would almost be larger then the original post, so I am
instead writing up an entry myself. The post describes several ways to
obtain the user's timezone and use that to pre-fill a form. None of them
are working properly though. I'll try to explain for each of them why
not, but first of all it is important to know what a timezone actually
is.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A timezone is a set of rules that determines the UTC offset for
different times around the year for a specific location. Because
of daylight savings time, a specific location can have two (or more)
different UTC offsets depending on what point in time you look at it.
Some areas might have had different rules in the past, even in the same
country. An example here is China, where currently there is only
one timezone, but previously there were multiple. Thus there are
different timezones for the different locations in China, even
though the current UTC offset is the same for all of them.
Timezones are identified by Country/City or Country/Subcountry/City.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The offering by &lt;a href="http://www.maxmind.com/timezone.txt"&gt;MaxMind&lt;/a&gt; allows you to
link a country/region combination to Timezone identifier. For the US it
subdivides this per state even. However, it misses the different
timezones for Russia, Australia and even Indiana, USA.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.ip2location.com/ip-country-region-city-latitude-longitude-zipcode-timezone.aspx"&gt;IP2Location&lt;/a&gt;
only provides a single UTC offset per IP range, totally ignoring
daylight savings time.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://www.hostip.info/dl/index.html"&gt;Hostip.info&lt;/a&gt;
solution I can't access because phpclasses requires some stupid
registration.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As for the author's own solution, using JavaScript, is flawed at least
partly as well. In his example JavaScript only returns a UTC offset.
Luckily it is possible to detect the correct timezone quite a bit
better by using some of PHP's functionality. The following bit of code
uses both the UTC offset and the timezone abbreviation to find out the
user's timezone:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?php
if (!isset($_GET['tzinfo'])) {
?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
var d = new Date()
var tza = d.toLocaleString().split(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;).slice(-1)
var tzo = d.getTimezoneOffset()
window.location = window.location + '?tzinfo=' + tza + '|' + tzo
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?php
} else {
list( $abbr, $offset ) = explode( '|', $_GET['tzinfo']);
echo timezone_name_from_abbr( $abbr, $offset * -60 );
}
?&amp;gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is still not perfect of course, because it would for example give
the same result for most of Europe (Europe/Berlin).
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Figuring out the user's timezone can be done by using a
high-accuracy database of IPs to lat/longitudes such as &lt;a href="http://hostip.info"&gt;hostip.info&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.maxmind.com/app/city"&gt;MaxMind&lt;/a&gt; offer, as well as a
mapping from location to timezone. The latter however, is not available
as far as I know. If however a data file that has proper definitions of
the different timezone boundaries exist (mostly, on a per-province level
would be enough), then such a tool can be easily build. I saw that &lt;a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; has such a map,
but I can't really find the raw data for that unfortunately. It would
however, be awesome to have such a data file.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/xdebug_logo.png' align='left' alt=''/&gt;
Since a few days, there is a new package in Debian: &lt;a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/2008/05/msg00361.html"&gt;php5-xdebug&lt;/a&gt;.
After a few years of talking licenses, due to the help of Martin
Meredith and &lt;a href="http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/"&gt;François
Marier&lt;/a&gt; Xdebug can finally be installed with apt-get. See the
synaptic screen shot as well:

  <title>Location for PHP Vikinger</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/location_for_php_vikinger.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
We've now found a definite location for &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org"&gt;PHP Vikinger&lt;/a&gt;. It will be at one of
the old factory buildings here at &lt;a href="http://www.klosteroya.no/"&gt;Klosterøya&lt;/a&gt;, close to &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ Systems'&lt;/a&gt; offices. The room has about space
for 80 people, and has a nice view over the river southwards. About 20
people from Norway, Iceland, the UK, Germany and Denmark have signed up
so far. This means there is still plenty of space for you! See &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org"&gt;http://phpvikinger.org&lt;/a&gt; for more
information, and the &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org/news/news-2008-04-22"&gt;invitation&lt;/a&gt;.

  <title>Firefox and 64 bit Java Plugin</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/firefox_and_64_bit_java_plugin.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
Because the lazy bastards at &lt;a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4802695"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;
still didn't manage to make a 64 bit version of their Java plugin, you
have to go through all sorts of hoops to make it actually work. Normally
I wouldn't really care about this, but unfortunately my bank decided to
require Java working in the browser for authentication. Four hours of my
time later, I managed to get it working. To save others from some of the
pain, here is how I did that:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
1. Download from &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/JDK-1.4.2/amd64/"&gt;ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/JDK-1.4.2/amd64/&lt;/a&gt;
the file &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/JDK-1.4.2/amd64/03/j2sdk-1.4.2-03-linux-amd64.bin"&gt;j2sdk-1.4.2-03-linux-amd64.bin&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
2. I downloaded it to ~/install, so go into that directory and run:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
chmod +x j2sdk-1.4.2-03-linux-amd64.bin

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
3. Run:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
./j2sdk-1.4.2-03-linux-amd64.bin

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and wait until it's done installing (make sure it mentions
"Uncompressing Blackdown Java 2 Standard Edition SDK
v1.4.2-03" at some point).
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
4. Now, to make it work as a plugin, you have to link (not copy,
as that makes the browser crash) the plugin to your mozilla directory.
For me:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
cd /home/derick/.mozilla/plugins
ln -s /home/derick/install/j2sdk1.4.2⇢
  /jre/plugin/amd64/mozilla/libjavaplugin_oji.so .

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
5. Restart the browser and check whether the blackdown java plugin shows
up if you go to &lt;a href="about:plugins"&gt;about:plugins&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/phpv.gif' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org"&gt;PHP Vikinger&lt;/a&gt; unconference,
to be held in Skien, Norway on June 21st is now open for &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org/register"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt;. You can find
the full invitation and announcement &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org/news/news-2008-04-22"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I
will repeat the highlights.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First of all, this is a free event, but we do require you to register
for it to see whether we would have enough space. Places to sleep, and
getting to Skien should be arranged by yourself. We made a &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org/directions"&gt;information page&lt;/a&gt; with
some suggestions though. The &lt;a href="http://php.no"&gt;Norwegian PHP
User group&lt;/a&gt; has reports and videos from &lt;a href="http://php.no/phpvikinger"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. The unconference open
for all, from beginners to advanced PHP users. At the moment there are
about 12 registrations, from people from Norway, Germany, Iceland and
the UK. Hope to see you here!

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org"&gt;PHP Vikinger&lt;/a&gt; unconference
will be held for the third year in &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/6c2ybw="&gt;Skien, Norway&lt;/a&gt;. Just like
previous years it follows directly after &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ
Systems&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://conference.ez.no"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; which
puts this year's &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org"&gt;PHP Vikinger&lt;/a&gt;
on June 21st, the longest day of the year.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Flickr features some pictures from &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/phpvikinger"&gt;previous
years&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="http://php.no"&gt;PHP Norge&lt;/a&gt; has a report
from &lt;a href="http://php.no/phpvikinger"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. Let me know
(through the e-mail on the &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org"&gt;PHP
Vikinger&lt;/a&gt; website) if you're interested, and if you want to suggest
topics.

  <title>Brasil Conference Wrap-up</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/brasil_conference_wrapup.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
In the beginning of this month I attended the &lt;a href="http://www.temporealeventos.com.br/?area=13"&gt;PHP Conference
Brasil&lt;/a&gt;. Besides speaking on &lt;a href="http://xdebug.org"&gt;Xdebug&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://ez.no/ezcomponents"&gt;eZ Components&lt;/a&gt; I also spend a few
extra days as holiday there.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During those extra days I flew to Foz do Iguaçu to have a look at the
&lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/brasil2006/aab"&gt;Itaipu
dam&lt;/a&gt; on the border with Paraguay and &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/brasil2006/aak"&gt;Iguaçu
falls&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/iguacu.png' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Besides the falls there are many other things to see in the park, such
as &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/brasil2006/aao"&gt;butterflies&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/brasil2006/abi"&gt;very big
ants&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After visiting the park I travelled further south to visit one of my
colleagues, &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/brasil2006/abq"&gt;Melissa&lt;/a&gt;.
Together we travelled to Gramado, a very German &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/brasil2006/abm"&gt;looking
city&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the rest of the pictures check my &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/brasil2006"&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt;. There
are also a few &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/brasil2006-panorama"&gt;panoramas&lt;/a&gt;
available.

  <title>Just too late for sunset</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/just_too_late_for_sunset.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
I usually try to get out in the weekend a bit instead of staying inside
the house. The weather was great yesterday so I invited &lt;a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de"&gt;Sebastian&lt;/a&gt; for a little trip to
Mølen to take pictures at sunset. Unfortunately, we were two minutes
too late to see the sun set. Luckily that did not stop us from taking
pictures - just after sunset there is still some sunlight that hits the
clouds turning them red. Here you see Sebastian taking a picture of just
those red clouds:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/photos/dsc_0293.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the sun sets the light decreases which allows you to play a little
bit with longer exposures. You can get very nice effects such as in this
four second exposure of waves breaking on the (rocky) shore:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/photos/dsc_0311.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you instead of a close up take a bit wider image of the shore it
gives an eery feeling just like this shot of the waves and water flowing
inbetween the rocks that were deposited here by a glacier a long time
ago:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/photos/dsc_0333b.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  <title>Iceland - Fire and Water</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/iceland_fire_and_water.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
Most people don't mention "Iceland" as their top number one
holiday destination. However I'm a bit strange and decided to go to
just this place on holiday this year. After some investigations it
seemed that the best time of year was somewhere around the end of July
regarding temparature, however you never know certain about what to
expect. That means packing all types of clothes... summer
clothes, but also a thick winter jacket, skiing clothes and rain
clothes. Of course, depending on what you are going to do exactly. I
wanted to see all possible types of terrain on iceland, which includes
nice warm lagoons (swim wear) and glacier (warm clothes is a good idea
there). Flights to Iceland are not very cheap either, but then again,
nor is anything else cheap on Iceland. (Yes, the alcohol tax is even
higher than in Norway). After a bit of investigation in the different
points-of-interest on Iceland with the help of some locals (thanks
Helgi and Bjori!) and the Lonely Planet I headed to Iceland with a
friend on July 6th.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
101 Reykjavik
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After getting to Keflavik airport way to late at night we managed to
find our way to the guesthouse just to find that I fluked the
reservation and they they expected us to arrive the next day. That
meant that we had to sleep in "sleeping bag accomodations"
which was not so confortable but I really didn't care after this overly
long trip. A guesthouse is normally just a small step down from a hotel
usually without people cleaning up your room every day. It does however
provide a good and somewhat cheaper place to stay at.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-bluelagoon.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next day we toured around Reykjavik and the Reykjanes peninsula a
bit and basically just waited until our room at the guest house was
ready. After a well needed shower to get rid of all the smells we met
up with a local and headed for a relaxing bath in the Blue Lagoon, the
most famous (but definitely not the only) geothermal pool in Iceland.
Helgi suggested to have dinner at ... and so we went there for a good
meal. The best meat in Iceland is sheep or lamb and you figure out why
once you start out driving in the country side... the only animal that
you'd find there is sheep... and you find them literally everywhere -
both off the road and on the roads.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Þingvellír (Thingvellir)
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-thingvellir.jpg' align='right' alt=''/&gt;
Iceland begun quite some time ago with the first parliament ever in
930. The parliament was build on a site called Þingvellír which is
now part of a national park. Besides the site of the former parliament
the general landscape is also quite interesting as well as there is a
massive lava ridge cutting across the landscape there as well as some
water filled gorges and (ofcourse) a waterfall. From Þingvellír we
avoided the ring road on the way back to Reykjavik and instead took
some road closer to the south of the country. Little did we know as
suddendly the road turned into a gravel road which we had to follow for
the next, say, 50 kilometers. The road did however pass an interesting
site with lots of water coming up from the ground in bright coloured
mud pools.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Water
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As proper tourists we visited two other popular sites the next day.
Starting off on the southern ring road we left busy Reykjavik to visit
"Geysir".
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Before we ended up at the geysirs we drove past the Keriđ explosion
crater. We actually tried to have a look at this one the day before but
our map had it in a totally wrong place, however my GPS map (!! add
link) did have it correctly. (!! add stuff about this event). All that
as left now is a crater which now houses a small lake in the middle.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-strokkur.jpg' align='left' alt=''/&gt; The
English word geysir finds its origin in exactly the site which formerly
housed this great natural water fountain in Iceland. However, in the
last few years the original geysir does no longer function properly and
only rarely spits out its water into the air. However at the same site
there is another geysir called Strokkur which still performs well.
About every 5 to 10 minutes it bursts out water into the air, however
each bursts intensity varies quite a bit. You need to be a bit lucky to
see a "big one". Besides Strokkur there are also a number of
smaller less regular geysirs and "Bluesi" - a very blue pool
with warm water.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From the geysir field we then proceeded towards Gullfoss - the Golden
Falls - named because its always present rainbow. However... if there
is no sun there won't be a rainbow either ofcourse. We were lucky and
the weather was fair so we could enjoy the magic of the great falls.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Past the great glacier
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-puffin.jpg' align='left' alt=''/&gt;
Leaving Reykjavik behind we set off for Höfn (pronounced like
"Hùb"). Along this route there are many smaller and larger
waterfalls including one of Iceland's finest called
"Seljalandsfoss". We went to see a few of those and then
wandered off the ring road to have a look at the Dyrhólaey plateau
where there is a large colony of puffins as well. We spend some time
trying to get as close to the puffins as possible for a good photo and
then proceeded our route to Höfn. When driving along the southern ring
road we passed lots of lava fields and glacier tongues. The glacier
toungues are all part of the largest icecap of Europe: Vatnajökull.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-glacier.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
About an hour before Höfn we passed the Jökulsárlón bay which is
filled with icebergs from the Breiđamerkurjökull glacier. This bay
gives a very strange feeling as it looks like it just comes out of a
movie. Coincidentally we figured out later that parts of a James Bond
film (Die Another Day) was shot here on this bay. Höfn itself is a
tiny tiny town with little to do, however we would only use it as base
camp for our glacier expedition.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hike on Svínafellsjökull glacier
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next morning we left early from Höfn to be on time for our 10
o'clock appointment with the Icelandic Mountain Guides. This little
plan of ours almost went wrong because at the Jökulsárlón bay they
where working on the bridge which set us back by about 20 minutes. We
barely made it on time to the base camp of the mountain guides just to
find that they had us down for 14:00 and not 10:00. Luckily there was
still some space for us in the 10:00 tour. There was not much Icelandic
about our guide as he was there on an exchange project from New Zealand:
Ben. Ben took us out on a trip over the lower parts of the
Svínafellsjökull glacier and explained us about the different things
that make up a glacier. Basically a glacier is just compressed snow but
because of gravity this compressed mass starts moving down the valleys
until there is a point where the sun is winning from the accumulation
of snow. Here the glacier melts and ends. Between the main icecap
Vatnajökull and the edge are the glacier valleys and ice falls. Just
after we came off the glacier it started to pour so we just drove back
to Höfn and stayed in. I managed to assemble most of my panoramas and
manage all my photos that I'd taken so far.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From Höfn to Akureyri
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rain, rain and more rain was the case this day as well when we passed
past numerous bays and inlets on the eastern side of Iceland and later
through high plains with lava fields. Somewhat closer to Myvatn we made
a small detour to see the Krafla region's vulcanic activity but bad wind
and rain killed that plan. We did manage to have a look at the Krafla
power station where electricity is won from earth heated water in the
form of steam. The small tour of the plant was done by a girl who've
had this summer job for the past 4 years and was happy to answer our
questions, especially because were not so loud as the three tour busses
that left when we just got there I suppose. We promised to come back to
the Krafla area to see more of it the next day as weather was supposed
to improve a lot.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Waterfalls and Vulcanoes
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And indeed the weather did improve. With 18°C and sunny it was the
perfect day to investigate some of the waterfalls in the area and then
head back to the Krafla region. First on the menu was Gođafoss, which
is situated very close to the ring road itself. From there on we went
to the Ásbyrgi canyon on the north side of the road that leads to
Dettifoss. The road that leads to Dettifoss is a 25 km long gravel road
(doesn't matter from which end) that goes over some very intersting
landscape which can only be similar to something as remote as the moon.
There are actually multiple waterfalls in this river and you can get
close to three without too much walking. The first one is
Hafragillsfoss, which is rather uninspiring as you can see Dettifoss'
spray in the background already. Dettifoss is actually quite ugly with
black water but it is the most powerful waterfall in Iceland so you
shouldn't really miss it.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-pothole.jpg' align='right' alt=''/&gt; From
the same carpark that serves Dettifoss it's a nice 1.5 km hike to the
third waterfall that you can get to, Selfoss. After visiting those
three falls we proceeded southward to end up in the Krafla region, this
time with some sun. Now the rain was gone we could actually see the big
Viti explosion crater and walk a bit around it. Another popular hike
here is the one around Lernhjúkur that takes you through a geothermic
area with lots of hot springs and the lava fields that were created
with the latest erruptions in this area. You can quite clearly show
where the lava came from and how it flowed. It was also clear that the
area is still active as the ground was usually warm and there were lots
of steam vents spraying bad smelling vapor into the air. Nearby is the
Hverarönd area which also has a lot of interesting pools.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Dimmuborgir
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-dimmu.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On our last day on the North side of the country we again traveled to
the Myvatn area to see Dimmuborgir, the black castles. However before
we went there we tried to have a look at some intersting lava pillars
that can be found just inside the lake. It is quite obvious why the
name of the lake is Myvatn (Mosquito lake) as the were literally swarms
of mosquitoes attacking us as soon as we got out of the car. Even at the
Dimmuborgir site the mosquitoes were quite persistent however not as bad
as closer to the lake. Dimmuborgir has some intersting formations of
lava resembling buildings and even a church. On the way back we also
visited the Laufás farm museum which has some restored old homes.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To the west
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-kirkufjell.jpg' align='left' alt=''/&gt;
After Akureyri we traveled to the Snæfellsness peninsula on the west
of Iceland. Unfortunately this day was again full of rain and lots of
wind so we didn't really see a lot besides dirt against the car window.
We stayed in a tiny town called Grundarfjórdur in a tiny but cosy hotel
which also serves as the local restaurant. The town lies under the realm
of Kirkufjell which we actually couldn't quite see just yet. With
promises that the weather would clear up the next day we headed for bed
early.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Snæfellsness Peninsula
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-arnarstapi.jpg' align='right' alt=''/&gt;
At the westernern part of Iceland is the Snæfellsness peninsula with
its main feature being the Snæfellsnessjökull glacier. But there are
many more sites along the coast, although some of them might be a hard
to get to. The Lonely Planet helped here a bit and we eventually made
it to some very little traveled place: Öndsverdnes - the most western
point of Europe - Very remote and actually quite boring. However when
traveling further south along the coast the weather cleared and we had
some nice walks along the coast near Arnarstapi where the water carved
out interesting features in the rocks. The small hikes here however
were the end of the holiday as we needed to head back for Reykjavik to
catch the next day's early morning flight.
