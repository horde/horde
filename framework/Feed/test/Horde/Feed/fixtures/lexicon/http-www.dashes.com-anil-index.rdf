        &lt;p&gt;Hey, NowPublic &lt;a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/world/mostpublic-index"&gt;made a list of the 50 most influential web people in New York&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm on it at number six. So, thanks to the folks who made the list, and I appreciate the recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="NowPublic" src="http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/nowpublic-logo.png" width="227" height="51" class="imgright" /&gt; However, every time a similar list comes out, I have a number of responses that immediately come to mind, and most of my friends who have to suffer through my ranting reply with some variation of "You're just complaining because you're not on the list!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; on the list. Which means it's a chance to talk about the reasons, good and bad, why these sorts of lists exist, and what purpose they can serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Apparently, I'm on the &lt;a href="http://www.techcult.com/top-100-web-celebrities/"&gt;TechCult Top 100 Web Celebrities&lt;/a&gt; list, too. Which appears to be even more blatantly link-baiting, though again, the company I'm keeping there is nice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First and foremost, organizations (whether they're websites, media organizations, publishers, individuals, institutions, whatever) create these lists to solidify their power and influence, and to promote their own authority. This generally works, with the most exceptional examples like Time's Person of the Year actually acting to amplify the publication's own profile. With that kind of success, it's easy to understand how Time decided to also create a Time 100 list as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For less-known organizations, like NowPublic, having a list like this acts as a phenomenal engine of promotion. People who have a high profile are generally well-known, at least in part, because they put an effort into being well-known. Therefore, putting their name on a list is an extremely effective way to get their attention. On the web, we call this link-baiting, but offline, it's simply called flattery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These types of lists &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be useful. One of the earliest and most fundamental milestones in the formation of a community is the desire for certain members to recognize those that (appear to) exemplify the values that the community aspires to, or would like to be identified by. Similarly, promoting unsung or less-known members of a community can be a useful method of indicating a desire for a community's values to evolve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- * It's a nice cyclical marker of progress. The entertainment industry spends the first few months of the year in the throes of Award Season, with the Emmys and Grammies and Oscars and the like all serving not just as moments of recognition, but as reminders that another year has passed since the last one. It's been interesting to see this in our own industry as the Webby awards grew in stature, plummeted to an ignominious depth (The year Ben and Mena won one for &lt;a href="http://www.movabletype.com/"&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt;, there wasn't even an awards ceremony, just a Flash animation online.) and have since regained some level of renown. --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists are &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; from awards. Everybody on them is a winner, of sorts, so there's very little sense of bitterness between people on the list. Similarly, having a large number of people be recognized increases the aspirational value for those who &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; on the list -- it's easy to pick someone on a lengthy list who seems undeserving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating this kind of content is perfect for the lazy days of summer. Fondly referred to in the publishing industry as "listicles", assembling faux-scientific methods of cataloging potential list members is a perfect task for interns. Here in New York, all of our local media editors traipse off to the Hamptons to sit out the sweltering days of July or August, and by amazing coincidence, much of local media publishes their "Best Of" articles around the same time. It's a credit to NowPublic that they've decided, interestingly, to publish the methodology for calculating influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pointing out these structural circumstances which occasion the creation of such lists doesn't mean that they're not still flattering and appreciated. It's nice to see your name on something. One of NowPublic's stated criteria for evaluation is accessibility, and as someone who's had his mobile phone number sitting on the side of his website for years, I am happy to see that's a factor in evaluating influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are, of course, some lists which are really important. Such as the &lt;a href="http://publicschoolintelligentsia.com/?p=140"&gt;Top 10 Boy Bloggers We'd Let Rub Our Touchpads&lt;/a&gt;. Congratulations to Nick Denton and Jason Kottke for being the only guys who are on both the NowPublic list and on this more esteemed accounting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to NowPublic for the recognition, and congratulations to the many friends and acquaintances of mine on the list. With only one exception, it's fantastic company to be part of and I can't wait to see who they pick in other cities and in New York next year.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes if you do something very difficult, and you do it really well, the end result is that your achievement becomes completely invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Twitter logo" src="http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/twitter.png" width="210" height="49" class="imgright" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned a year and a half ago that &lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/02/consider-twitte.html"&gt;I like Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. That was a little bit less common a position to take back then, but in the months since, tons of people have taken to the little messaging service, so clearly this was no great insight on my part -- it's just a useful, fun service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, that popularity has not been without its problems. Twitter's gotten a reputation for being unreliable, as a result of its rapid growth. In fact, in many ways, the &lt;a href="http://buzzfeed.com/buth/fail-whale"&gt;Fail Whale&lt;/a&gt; and its related frustrations has come to define Twitter's brand more than almost anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm no expert at these things, but there are a lot of reasons startups fail, and the reasons almost never include the fact that thousands of users clamoring for a service. Indeed, it seems to me that most companies (whether they're tech startups or anything else) fail because of being poorly managed. Put another way, execution is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, it's worth pointing out how particularly well-executed Twitter's recent acquisition of Summize has been. I don't know any of the deals of the financial or business arrangements, except that I'm a little disappointed that Twitter isn't maintaining a presence in New York City, instead moving all of the employees to San Francisco. That nitpick aside, the public face of this transition was extremely well executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ev Williams, co-founder and the most public face of Twitter, speaks about the deal at some length in this &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/15/interview-with-evan-william-summize-acquisition-api-issues-and-their-revenue-model/"&gt;excellent, candid interview with Techcrunch&lt;/a&gt;. (Which site, by the way, may rank as my "most improved" blog of 2008.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumors of the Summize acquisition leaked a few weeks ago, but both companies kept discipline around communications and didn't acknowledge or respond to the conversation. And then, when it came time to announce the deal, the sites had been fully integrated, a &lt;a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2008/07/finding-perfect-match.html"&gt;lengthy and personable blog post&lt;/a&gt; complete with a sketch of some future ideas for integration was posted, consistent branding was in place on the acquired site, and the roadmap for what was going on with employees affected by the acquisition was clearly communicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, that's a formidable amount of coordination to happen across the country, while business deals are being worked out, and while maintaining secrecy about the fact that it's taking place. And, all of that was done with an eye towards providing a good user experience to their shared customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things to criticize in such deals most of the time, though it seems likely that this will be a successful acquisition, from an outsider's point of view. But what's striking to me is that, as quick as so many are to criticize Twitter (fairly) for technological problems, people haven't been as eager to acknowledge a remarkable discipline and execution on the business side of the company. Frankly, all of those who'd suggested that &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22should+buy+twitter%22"&gt;Twitter should be sold to a larger company&lt;/a&gt; seem to have forgotten that almost none of the big companies suggested as acquirers have a history of consistently pulling off this kind of execution. And that's even more true for the smaller innovative companies that they've acquired.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">
        &lt;div style="float : left; padding : 10px;"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates has pulled off one of the greatest hacks in technology and business history, by turning Microsoft's success into a force for social responsibility. Imagine imposing a tax on every corporation in the developed world, collecting $100 per white-collar worker per year, and then directing one third of the proceeds to curing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS &lt;/span&gt;and malaria. That, effectively, is what Bill Gates has done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671880748/2020-20" class="imgright"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gates biography" src="http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/gates-bio.jpg" width="120" height="178" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On a day when everyone will be noting Gates' departure from day-to-day involvement in his work at Microsoft, it's worth noting the work he's done which will likely be seen as his greatest legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unofficial goal of Microsoft in its early years was to see a computer on every desk and in every home, presumably running Microsoft software. That sort of vision, put forth in a time when the conventional wisdom dictated that personal computers might disappear entirely, was astounding enough. But by the year 2000, just 25 years after its founding, Microsoft had &lt;em&gt;achieved&lt;/em&gt; that improbable goal, at least in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the &lt;a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/"&gt;Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is well-covered, but it's important to consider the context in which the Foundation was created. What would you do if you defined the most ambitious goal you could imagine, and then achieved it just 25 years later? And what if you had done so while still relatively young, not even fifty years old? That's the position Gates found himself in just a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people, when faced with the realization of their greatest dreams, will respond at first with elation, and then later settle into melancholy or even depression. It can be overwhelming to think that there's nothing left to do. Instead, Gates upped the ante.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How high did he set his new goals? How about curing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;? Or ending the spread of malaria? What about improving life expectancy and quality of life for the poorest people in the world? After achieving a goal that seemed outlandish, it's clear that the only logical next step is to try to achieve a goal that seems nearly impossible. I have to point out that sense of thinking "Okay, we won -- what next?" is extremely unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plainly, I admire Bill Gates for this. I think there are few people who, instead of resting on their laurels, decide to stake their reputation and fortune on goals that are not only altruistic, but that conventional wisdom dictates may not be achievable in a single lifetime. There are many other ways to measure a man, and I'm not diminishing at all the fact that Microsoft as a corporation has made regrettable, unfortunate, and even illegal decisions during Bill Gates' tenure. But imagine if someone had defined an explicit goal of a "cure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS &lt;/span&gt;tax" for corporations, and then tried to get that enacted. The fact that, effectively, this has happened is remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are many who still want to think, despite the commitment of incredible resources and formidable talents to support the Gates Foundation's mission, that all of this philanthropic work is an attempt to simply generate good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR.&lt;/span&gt; But that simply doesn't follow the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Family Tradition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, Bill Gates doesn't just come from a family tradition of philanthropy: It's actually a significant part of the reason he got the single biggest opportunity of his professional career. You can see the family tradition today, with the founding chairman of the Gates Foundation being William Gates Sr., Bill's father. But you have to go back twenty years earlier, to Gates' mother &lt;a href="http://www.washington.edu/uaa/marygates.html"&gt;Mary Maxwell Gates&lt;/a&gt;, to understand how philanthropic work opened doors for a fledgling Bill Gates and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Maxwell Gates was deeply involved in the work of the United Way for many years before her passing in 1994, most notably as its first female chair. And one of the connections she made through that work back in 1980 was to &lt;a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/chairmen/chairmen_7.html"&gt;John Opel&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM &lt;/span&gt;who was also a member of the United Way's executive committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's become fairly clear in the years since that at least part of the reason &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM &lt;/span&gt;was willing to hire Microsoft to create an operating system for the initial release of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; PC was because of the introductions made through that connection. Taking a risk on an unproven small software company was a big leap to take, and it's one that ended up being the greatest turning point in the history of the biggest software company that's ever been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's fitting, then, that that opportunity is honored by having the founder of the company return all of his efforts and the vast majority of his wealth to an even more ambitious new vision for philanthropic work. So, congratulations to Bill Gates on his new job, and I hope this hack is even more successful than all the ones that he's done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Essential Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few recommendations for those who want to understand more about Bill Gates and his legacy:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen Manes and Paul Andrews published &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671880748/2020-20"&gt;Gates: How Mirosoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry&lt;/a&gt;, back in 1992. I have been a big fan of this book since it came out. It was released before his period of greatest fame after Windows 95 launched, and perhaps as a result is more insightful than later efforts that tried to case Gates' entire life and career merely in the context of post-monopoly Microsoft. (I've shown the original, gloriously awful, cover photo above, but I think the paperback edition has less floppy-disk lunacy.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortune has &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/storysupplement/gates_microsoft/index.html"&gt;a slideshow covering 30 years of Bill Gates' career&lt;/a&gt;, narrated by the man himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/141821.asp"&gt;Gates' 2003 rant about the shoddiness of the Windows user experience&lt;/a&gt;. Though this has prompted lots of "haw, haw, Windows sucks!" responses from geeks, I though it was interesting to look past the memo as merely a document of a typically dysfunctional large company. What struck me was a founder, nearly 30 years after starting the company, and decades after becoming wealthy beyond his wildest dreams, still obviously had both great passion and an enormous amount of technical knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those same themes of passion and technical competence are echoed in Joel Spolsky's &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html"&gt;essay about his first BillG review&lt;/a&gt;. Joel revisited this in a less-geeky version of the essay &lt;a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080701/how-hard-could-it-be-glory-days.html"&gt;published in Inc. magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href="http://newtalk.org/"&gt;Newtalk&lt;/a&gt;, a site dedicated to substantive political discussions, hosted a conversation asking "&lt;a href="http://newtalk.org/2008/06/is-it-possible-to-fix-governme.php"&gt;Is it possible to fix government?&lt;/a&gt;". In his response to host Philip Howard, &lt;a href="http://newtalk.org/2008/06/is-it-possible-to-fix-governme.php"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC &lt;/span&gt;mayor Michael Bloomberg reveals&lt;/a&gt; that it's his first time responding to a conversation online:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the opportunity to participate in this discussion, Philip. This is my first time participating in an online discussion, but I can assure you I am not at home wearing my pajamas. This is a great group, the kind of crowd I'd enjoy having over for dinner. So I'm just going to pretend that we're all sitting around a big table. I always learn something when I break bread with diverse groups of talented people, and I expect this conversation will be no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a little bit depressing that, more than ten years after blogging's taken off, even some of the most prominent politicians in the country still think bloggers are folks at home in their pajamas. But I will take it as a sign of at least a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; progress that Newtalk is a &lt;a href="http://www.movabletype.com/products/community-solution.html"&gt;Movable Type Community Solution&lt;/a&gt; site, so maybe indirectly my day job helped Mayor Mike make his first steps online.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08150_discovery_lands.html"&gt;Space Shuttle Discovery glided home&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, one of the electronic components which made it possible was the humble &lt;a href="http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/8086/"&gt;Intel 8086 processor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="8088B1" src="http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/8088B1-thumb-450x462.jpg" width="450" height="462" class="imgcenter" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the chips powering support systems for the shuttle were purchased from a motley variety of suppliers including sellers on eBay. The New York Times &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE2DF1739F931A25756C0A9649C8B63"&gt;told the story&lt;/a&gt; six years ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilian electronic markets now move so fast, and the shuttles are so old, that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA &lt;/span&gt;and its contractors must scramble to find substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA &lt;/span&gt;procurement experts would go through old catalogs and call suppliers to try to find parts. Today, the hunt has become easier with Internet search engines and sites like eBay, which auctions nearly everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8086 processor just &lt;a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,146957/article.html"&gt;celebrated the 30th anniversary of its release&lt;/a&gt;. The space shuttle program just celebrated the 27th anniversary of the maiden shuttle launch.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One of the most satisfying and fun things I've ever seen in my job was the sight of my friend and coworker &lt;a href="http://sippey.com/"&gt;Michael Sippey&lt;/a&gt; onstage with Steve Jobs and the Apple crew, showing off &lt;a href="http://www.typepad.com/features/blog-iphone.html"&gt;TypePad for iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. In our line of business, Apple keynotes are just about the biggest shows in town, and Sippey killed it on the toughest stage around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Michael &lt;a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/06/on-stage.html"&gt;graciously mentions in his own post&lt;/a&gt;, the demo wouldn't have been possible without our great developer (and demo god in his own right) Ray Marshall, along with Stephane Delbecque on our team who helped pull the entire effort together. You can &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/wwdc08/"&gt;watch the whole keynote&lt;/a&gt; on Apple's site, or just see a short clip of the TypePad demo for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="335" height="360"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.cnet.com/av/video/flv/newPlayers/universal.swf" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;param name="FlashVars" value="playerType=embedded&amp;amp;value=50002569" /&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.cnet.com/av/video/flv/newPlayers/universal.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="335" height="360" allowFullScreen="true" FlashVars="playerType=embedded&amp;amp;value=50002569" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while I'm happy for Michael and the team on such a great demo, it also made me happy to see Michael onstage showing that his knowledge of blogging is second to none. Michael was, along with &lt;a href="http://www.peterme.com/"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, one of the people who really inspired me to start blogging, and he's probably under-recognized as a pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of ways he's influenced blogging and our industry are countless: Even the biggest gadget blogs today &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; make a huge deal out of featuring big-name tech &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;s when they get an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW, &lt;/span&gt;but Michael &lt;a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1996/10/14.html"&gt;interviewed Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; for his seminal blog &lt;a href="http://theobvious.com/"&gt;Stating the Obvious&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;twelve years ago&lt;/em&gt;. I interviewed Michael for &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2007/04/michael_sippey.html"&gt;our series on the 10th anniversary of blogging&lt;/a&gt; last year, in which Michael talks about creating what was arguably the first link blog, Filtered for Purity, ten years ago. And of course, &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2004/08/michael-sippey.html"&gt;Mena mentioned Michael's joining Six Apart&lt;/a&gt; back in 2004 as our VP of Products. It's a role he's held ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add in his influence in efforts like advising the original &lt;a href="http://pyra.com/"&gt;Pyra&lt;/a&gt; team, which created Blogger, and it calls to mind the old chestnut about the Velvet Underground: Not everybody has read Michael Sippey's blog, but everyone who did, started a blog. (And at some point in recent history, it's possible that everyone who did started a blogging &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt;.) Congrats to my friend Michael on putting that experience on display on the biggest stage around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And oh yeah, if you're the best in the world at what you do, you can &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/jobs/"&gt;work at Six Apart&lt;/a&gt;, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Dedicated readers will recall me &lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2008/02/when-autotune-strikes.html"&gt;obsessing over&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2008/02/last-of-the-autotune.html"&gt;over-analyzing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2008/02/the-death-of-analog-vocoder-edition.html"&gt;Auto-Tune in pop music&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. It is, then, my pleasure to report that, thanks to the inestimable &lt;a href="http://sashafrerejones.com/"&gt;Sasha Frere-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, Auto-Tune analysis has gone legit. Behold, no less an authority than &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2008/06/09/080609crmu_music_frerejones?currentPage=all"&gt;the New Yorker weighs in on Auto-Tune&lt;/a&gt;, especially T-Pain's (ab)use of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, roughly, is what happens: Auto-Tune locates the pitch of a recorded vocal, and moves that recorded information to the nearest "correct" note in a scale, which is selected by the user. With the speed set to zero, unnaturally rapid corrections eliminate portamento, the musical term for the slide between two pitches. Portamento is a natural aspect of speaking and singing, central to making people sound like people. A nonmusical example of portamento would be "up-speak," a verbal tic common in some people under thirty. (Can you imagine the end of every sentence rising in pitch? Like a question?) Processed at zero speed, Auto-Tune turns the lolling curves of the human voice into a zigzag of right-angled steps. These steps may represent "perfect" pitches, but when sung pitches alternate too quickly the result sounds unnatural, a fluttering that is described by some engineers as "the gerbil" and by others as "robotic."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gerbil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/2008/06/09/080609on_audio_frerejones/"&gt;Now with audio&lt;/a&gt;! "Here Frere-Jones talks about how Auto-Tune has become a pop-music phenomenon, and demonstrates how it can transform the human voice, with the help of the music producer Tom Beaujour."&lt;/p&gt;

She got a gleam in her eyes when she started to talk about what life could've been like as a wired youngster, being able to "express yourself online in a way that you'd be totally afraid to do in real life." She added, "I think I would have had a lot of alter egos online as a kid if I had access to the internet."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;blockquote&gt;I started blogging when I was 25, and it was a much smaller blogosphere back in 2000. I was able to make my mistakes in oversharing, overexposure, and unmitigated egotism in a smaller pond, without the entire New York media world and Jimmy Kimmel staring at me. In some ways, blogging and I grew up together, so by the time I was doing national television, I'd already had lots of media training ... a luxury Emily Gould didn't seem to have. I also developed some personal boundaries before I had thousands of daily readers, a luxury Emily Gould also didn't have.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://electrolicious.com/2008/05/emily-gould"&gt;Ariel Meadow Stallings&lt;/a&gt;, on Emily Gould's recent &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/magazine/25internet-t.html?ei=5070&amp;amp;en=ec3c61edbcfe6cbb&amp;amp;ex=1212292800&amp;amp;emc=eta1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;NY Times Magazine&lt;/a&gt; cover story.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Because my name and my big ole' head are sitting on top of this page, it's probably not making the self-indulgence any worse to collect a few links to some recent places I've popped up online:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gawker.com/391246/your-twitter+stalking-power-list"&gt;Gawker recommended&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/anildash"&gt;my Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; as one to follow after &lt;a href="http://youngmanhattanite.com/2008/05/dont-shoot-canary.html"&gt;Krucoff posted a list to Young Manhattanite&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href="http://fimoculous.com/"&gt;Rex&lt;/a&gt;'s suggestions. The strange thing to me is that Gawker is (still!) such a presence in media circles in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC &lt;/span&gt;that 6,000 people would actually &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; such a thing. Of course, they're all just wannabees -- real Gawker credit comes from having been &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/news/chris-anderson/shades-of-launch-party-chris-anderson-and-anil-dash-11224.php"&gt;at the launch party&lt;/a&gt; five years ago. I'm just sayin'. (For more, similarly inane insights, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/anildash"&gt;add me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I helped &lt;a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/"&gt;Charlene Li&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. The Best Tech Industry Analyst) &lt;a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2008/03/how-i-made-833.html"&gt;save $8.33&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/12/unsolicited-testimonial-clear-card.html"&gt;offering up my testimonial about the Clear card&lt;/a&gt;. That's enough to pay for a subscription to dashes.com for more than a year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-05/st_alpha"&gt;Mat Honan wrote a piece in Wired&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://thebigwordproject.com/"&gt;The Big Word Project&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;del&gt;scam&lt;/del&gt; website where people pay for words. My site shows up because it's the link for the word "&lt;a href="http://www.thebigwordproject.com/search?word=purple"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;", even though I didn't do it myself. I blame Mike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRN &lt;/span&gt;has a (really very good) &lt;a href="http://www.crn.com/it-channel/207400714;jsessionid=EX21SA455BICUQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?pgno=1"&gt;look at what the technology industry wants from the Presidential candidates&lt;/a&gt;, with responses from the likes of Bill Gates and Paul Otellini. Inexplicably, &lt;a href="http://www.crn.com/it-channel/207400714;jsessionid=GGUUKCVWKQOVOQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?pgno=11"&gt;I'm in there, too&lt;/a&gt;: "The No. 1 thing we want to see is elected officials use social networking tools online as a tool for governance and for leadership when in office, just as they do to get elected." Basically, I am tired of politicians treating web communities as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM &lt;/span&gt;for their campaigns, instead of seeing the web as an opportunity for fixing government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And last but certainly not least, "&lt;a href="http://mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a10184.asp"&gt;So What Do You Do, Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt;". It's a really long interview with me by the folks at Mediabistro, in advance of my presentation at the &lt;a href="http://www.mediabistrocircus.com/"&gt;Mediabistro Circus&lt;/a&gt; event on Tuesday. If you know me, there's probably few surprises, but I was happy to get the chance to articulate a lot of points that I otherwise don't usually talk about explicitly. Most of all, I am really glad to help emphasize how vibrant the technology scene is here in New York City; My biggest goal in participating in these sorts of conferences here in New York is to show people that there's a lot more going on with tech here than people might realize if they're myopically focused on just Silicon Valley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you haven't been following &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/anildash"&gt;my Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, you're missing all the fun! In between &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/806678829"&gt;going aggro on teakettles&lt;/a&gt;, taking an unseemly joy in &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/799137112"&gt;crude wordplay&lt;/a&gt;, and in general trying to channel my incessant nattering into an &lt;a href="http://favotter.matope.com/en/user.php?user=anildash&amp;amp;mode=best"&gt;attempt at being entertaining&lt;/a&gt;. But now I've tried to do something a little bit different, starting a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/805608769"&gt;little Twitter contest&lt;/a&gt; with some simple rules of entry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, everybody, it's Ctrl-V time! Paste into Twitter whatever text you copied last, and @anildash me. Best paste gets a prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, I got &lt;strong&gt;160 responses&lt;/strong&gt; from over 150 different people, and I've assembled the results into a few categories here for your enjoyment. I removed the date stamps and other clutter from the responses, and formatted the (many!) links into readable formats with some very brief descriptions appended. The categories I've grouped them into include &lt;a href="#mundane"&gt;mundane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#passwords"&gt;passwords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#links"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#linkstext"&gt;links with text&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#actually"&gt;actually working&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#nerds"&gt;nerds and coders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#explainers"&gt;explainers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#jokers"&gt;jokers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#WTF"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="#pleasing"&gt;pleasant&lt;/a&gt;. And then, finally, from all these submissions, I name our &lt;a href="#winner"&gt;winner&lt;/a&gt;, along with the surprise prize. Enjoy, and please feel free to mention your favorites in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="mundane"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mundane&lt;/h4&gt;
These were, of course, the perfunctory entries in the contest, people who had the misfortune to have been doing something simple and ordinary when the contest launched. They're all exciting, talented individuals, but just had bad luck at the time with what was on the ole' clipboard.

Ah, the bread and butter of Twitter. A surprising number of wacky or topical news stories, along with the detritus of people passing along links to their friends. Almost all of these were originally TinyURLs; I rewrote them with brief summaries for convenience, but may have sacrificed some accuracy in the process.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jessamyn/statuses/805645421n"&gt;jessamyn&lt;/a&gt; Personally, I'm after the uncontrolled growth of pubic hair. Great hedge rows, barely contained by trousers. I try to get onto th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessamyn offers up, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jessamyn/statuses/805645914"&gt;after an apology to the rest of her followers&lt;/a&gt;, that the full quote she had copied was from a mailing list that she belongs to, and reads in its entirety: "Personally, I'm after the uncontrolled growth of pubic hair. Great hedge rows, barely contained by trousers. I try to get onto the N-Judah one day and my furry rose bush of a hair bloom parts the crowd, greeted by great choruses of outrage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a striking, vivid, and moving image. And one that's well-deserving of an award, in the eyes of this judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jessamyn's honor, thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/"&gt;Donors Choose&lt;/a&gt;, we've funded &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=182646"&gt;Whoooo, Whooo Ate What?&lt;/a&gt; This will provide 15 owl pellets for dissection by a group of kids in 4th grade . Let's just not tell them what the winning quote in our little contest was, shall we? No need to scar them for life.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/05/02/peggy-whitson-astronaut-print.html"&gt;Peggy Whitson is a 48-year-old biochemist who fell from space and landed in the steppes of Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. The eight people who greeted her didn't quite understand that they had encountered a spaceship gone astray, and asked about the origins of her boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the crash landing (termed a "ballistic reentry") Anatoly Perminov, the chief of Russia's Federal Space Agency referenced the naval tradition of having more women than men on board a ship as a "&lt;a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080419/soyuz_landing_080419/20080419"&gt;bad omen&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You know in Russia, there are certain bad omens about this sort of thing, but thank God that everything worked out successfully,'' he said. "Of course in the future, we will work somehow to ensure that the number of women will not surpass'' the number of men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenged by a reporter, Perminov responded: "This isn't discrimination. I'm just saying that when a majority (of the crew) is female, sometimes certain kinds of unsanctioned behaviour or something else occurs, that's what I'm talking about.''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat came from Russia. Peggy Whitson is from Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While New Yorkers don't mind correcting you, they also want to help you. In the subway or on the sidewalk, when someone asks a passerby for directions, other people, overhearing, may hover nearby, disappointed that they were not the ones asked, and waiting to see if maybe they can get a word in. New Yorkers like to be experts. Actually, all people like to be experts, but most of them satisfy this need with friends and children and employees. New Yorkers, once again, tend to behave with strangers the way they do with people they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/mytown-newyork.html?c=y&amp;amp;page="&gt;Joan Acocella&lt;/a&gt; in Smithsonian Magazine, on why New Yorkers seem rude, but are really just acting familiar with strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Five years ago, I said &lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/04/i-work-for-six.html"&gt;I work for Six Apart&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, that sort of thing was a big deal, not because of me, but because so few of us who loved blogging could get a job doing what we loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="sixapart-office-locations.gif" src="http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/sixapart-office-locations.gif" width="134" height="72" class="imgright" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, amazingly, it's become downright common to work in the blogging business. I have literally &lt;em&gt;dozens&lt;/em&gt; of friends who work on creating tools and technology for blogs, and dozens more who blog for a living as part or all of their job. I even get to work with the best of them, from San Francisco to Paris to Tokyo. And now I can celebrate the company and industry I support in the city that I love, since we have an office in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I'm immensely proud of working at &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/"&gt;Six Apart&lt;/a&gt;, even more proud to count such amazing coworkers as peers and friends, and proudest of all of what our community of bloggers has accomplished. When I started working at this company, my hopes were that we'd be able to teach more people about blogs, and that we'd be able to build a sustainable, ethical company that gave a bunch of talented people a great place to work. But in retrospect, I find it almost impossible to believe the role we've played in helping blogs become so common that they're taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not to say it's been easy. At Six Apart, we've made a number of mistakes, and learned from them. We've all been through a lot of stress, both personal and professional. But even after all we've been through, Mena wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.dollarshort.org/ds/2008/04/five-years-with.html"&gt;beautiful post&lt;/a&gt; in my honor, and last Friday offered one of the kindest compliments to me that I've ever gotten, recognition in front of all of my coworkers, a group of people whom I hold in the highest esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one point that she highlighted last week was that all acts of entrepreneurship are really acts of faith. My title these days (though I often cringe when I say it), is "Chief Evangelist". I've always been uncomfortable with the religious implications of it, but I've become comfortable with the fact that it reflects a bit of faith. This goes back to why I started doing this work in the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I make tools that help people communicate. Mostly because I love technology, mostly because I love to try and build things and to get other people to think these things are cool, too. And certainly because I'm hoping to impress my friends and family with the end results. But some small, central part of the effort is because I know I'm privileged to be able to talk to anyone in my family at any time. In the span of a few decades, my father went from not being able to even send a letter to his father for a few years to being able to instant message me frequently enough to pester me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our letters to each other used to be the documentation of the lives we'd lived, the entirety of our correspondence forming memoirs for those who weren't accomplished or pretentious enough to formally write out a memoir. I think that, among many other functions, this is one of the key roles that personal publishing can play in our lives. Weblogs and other social media document the lives we live and let us connect in ways that are, despite the cliché, genuinely new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more true than ever. I am glad to have stuck with a company, and with blogging, through both points of ceaseless hype and endless criticism. Well past any point of blogging being "cool" to the &lt;a href="http://valleywag.com/383176/six-apart-executive-fails-to-job+hop-follow-other-silicon-valley-rules"&gt;insular world of tech geeks&lt;/a&gt;, blogs have become enough of the fundamental infrastructure of communication to actually become &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; to the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, I had some personal goals, too. I wanted to work with good friends, with people I know and trust. I wanted to show people that New York City is, and will be, one of the centers for real, hardcore technology innovation and invention. (&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/jobs/"&gt;We're hiring&lt;/a&gt;!) I wanted to bring together the worlds of the two things I have always been passionate about, technology and media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="6a logo white.png" src="http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/6a%20logo%20white.png" width="118" height="70" class="imgright" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is likely obvious from &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2008/04/six-apart-services-media.html"&gt;our announcements&lt;/a&gt; this week, we're close to being all of the things I'd hoped a company like Six Apart might become. In just the past year, we've damn near reinvented the company, with Ben and Mena and our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; Chris Alden have been leading some brave efforts to do what few have the courage to do: &lt;strong&gt;Reimagine a company that's already successful&lt;/strong&gt; and growing, and picture it honoring its innovative roots in a way that's actually new. We've invented, launched, and promoted more things that make the web better in the past year than at any time since the beginning of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That kind of creative destruction, the willingness to take apart something that's working in order to make it something truly inspiring, is actually even more ambitious than I'd imagined Six Apart being when I'd joined. And it's the reason that, after five years, the milestone for me is that it feels much more like I'm starting a new job than that I've been at one for half a decade. I can't ask for much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
