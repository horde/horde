====================================
 Kolab_Format Development TODO List
====================================

 - Remove the use of the Horde_Date class from testing. It should be
   no problem to get the same code coverage without using the external
   class.

 - Do not overwrite anything from other clients.

 - Think about storing the data in iCal format.

 - Check how we deal with malformed XML data

 - KEP2

 - Remove translations or should we keep them for Cli?
