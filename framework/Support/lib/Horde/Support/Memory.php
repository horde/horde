/**
 * Simple interface for tracking memory consumption.
 *
 * <code>
 *  $t = new Horde_Support_Memory;
 *  $t->push();
 *  $used = $t->pop();
 * </code>
 *
 * Do not expect too much of this memory tracker. Profiling memory is not
 * trivial as your placement of the measurements may obscure important
 * information. As a trivial example: Assuming that your script used 20 MB of
 * memory befory you call push() the information you get when calling pop()
 * might only tell you that there was less than 20 MB of memory consumed in
 * between the two calls. Take the changes to internal memory handling of PHP in
 * between the different versions into account
 * (http://de3.php.net/manual/en/features.gc.performance-considerations.php) and
 * you should get an idea about why you might be cautious about the values you
 * get from this memory tracker.
