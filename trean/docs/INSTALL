 Installing Trean 1.0
======================

:Last update:   $Date: 2007/06/19 09:56:35 $

This document contains instructions for installing the Trean web-based
bookmarks application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Trean, see the
file README_ in the top-level directory of the Trean distribution.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Trean **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Trean runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Trean.

   .. Important:: Trean 1.0 requires version 4.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Trean. Many of Trean's prerequisites are also
                  Horde prerequisites. Additionally, many of Trean's optional
                  features are configured via the Horde install.

Configuring Trean
=================

1. Configuring Horde for Trean

   Trean requires a permanent ``DataTree`` backend in Horde to manage
   bookmarks.  If you didn't setup a DataTree backend yet, go to the
   configuration interface, select Horde from the list of applications and
   select a driver different than ``None`` on the ``DataTree System`` tab.
   Make sure that you ran the necessary scripts to create a storage backend for
   the DataTree system, e.g. one of the ``create.*.sql`` or
   ``horde_datatree.*.sql`` SQL scripts in ``horde/scripts/sql/``.  You should
   have done this already during the installation of Horde.

2. Configuring Trean

   To configure Trean, you must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator.  Use
   the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get to the administration page,
   and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to get the configuration page.
   Select ``Bookmarks`` from the selection list of applications, and click on
   the ``Configure`` button.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
   needed.  When done click on ``Generate Bookmarks Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Trean configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``trean/config/conf.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the other configuration files in
   the ``config/`` directory can be found in each file. You may create
   ``*.local.php`` versions of these files if you wish to customize Trean's
   appearance and behavior. See the header of the configuration files for
   details and examples. The defaults will be correct for most sites.

3. Testing

    It needs lots so just start playing.
