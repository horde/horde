 Installing Trean 0.1
======================

:Last update:   $Date: 2007/06/19 09:56:35 $

This document contains instructions for installing the Trean web-based
bookmarks application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Trean, see the
file README_ in the top-level directory of the Trean distribution.


Obtaining Trean
===============

Trean can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/trean/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/trean/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of Trean are available via CVS; see the
file `horde/docs/HACKING`_, or the website http://www.horde.org/source/, for
information on accessing the Horde CVS repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Trean **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Trean runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Trean.

   .. Important:: Trean requires version 3.2+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Trean's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Trean.

Configuring Trean
=================

1. Configuring Horde for Trean

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the applications['trean'] stanza.
      The 'status' parameter must be marked '=> active'.  If you have changed
      the location of Trean relative to Horde, either in the URL, in the
      filesystem or both, you must update the ``fileroot`` and ``webroot``
      settings to their correct values.

   b. Configuring a DataTree backend

      Trean requires a permanent ``DataTree`` backend in Horde to manage
      bookmarks.  If you didn't setup a DataTree backend yet, go to the
      configuration interface, select Horde from the list of applications and
      select a driver different than ``None`` on the ``DataTree System`` tab.
      Make sure that you ran the necessary scripts to create a storage backend
      for the DataTree system, e.g. one of the ``create.*.sql`` or
      ``horde_datatree.*.sql`` SQL scripts in ``horde/scripts/sql/``.  You
      should have done this already during the installation of Horde.

2. Configuring Trean

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the configuration files in the
   ``config/`` directory can be found in each file.  You may edit these files
   if you wish to customize Trean's appearance and behavior.  The defaults
   will be correct for most sites.

   To configure Trean, you must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator.  Use
   the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get to the administration page,
   and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to get the configuration page.
   Select ``Bookmarks`` from the selection list of applications, and click on
   the ``Configure`` button.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
   needed.  When done click on ``Generate Bookmarks Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Trean configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``trean/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Trean uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), or if you're having trouble using a
   provided translation, please see the `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for
   instructions.

3. Testing

    It needs lots so just start playing.
