This document contains instructions for installing the Kronolith web-based
calendar application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Kronolith, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Kronolith distribution.


Obtaining Kronolith
===================

Kronolith can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/kronolith/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/kronolith/

Bleeding-edge development versions of Kronolith are available via CVS; see the
file `horde/docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution for information on
accessing the Horde CVS repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Kronolith requires the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Kronolith runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common
   tools for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Kronolith.  You must use a version of Horde 3.0 or greater.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Kronolith's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Kronolith.

2. SQL support in PHP, or Kolab support in Horde

   Kronolith store its data in a backend - either an SQL database or a
   Kolab server. Build PHP with whichever SQL driver you require; see
   the Horde `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for more details on using databases
   with Horde, or the Kolab webclient documentation for how to set up
   Kronolith for Kolab.

   Note to MS-SQL users:
   In order to successfully use kronolith with MS-SQL from a linux server,
   you need to have mssql support compiled into php AND mssql support
   compiled into freetds AND mssql.datetimeconvert = Off in your php.ini.

3. Operating System with support for dates before 1970-01-01 [OPTIONAL]

   If you want to use dates earlier the January 1st 1970, for example
   birthdays, you need an Operating Systems that supports negative
   timestamps. Microsoft Windows does **not** support such dates.

4. The following PEAR package:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PEAR package)

   a. Date

      Kronolith uses the Date package for various date calculations.

   b. XML_Serializer [OPTIONAL]

      The XML_Serializer package is needed by the Date_Holidays package for
      the translation of holiday names::

         pear install XML_Serializer-beta

   c. Date_Holidays 0.21.0 [OPTIONAL]

      Kronolith can use the Date_Holidays package to show several sets of
      national and religious holidays and memorial days. Since Date_Holidays
      consists of a number of sub-packages, one for each country, you should
      install all packages at once::

         pear install Date_Holidays-alpha#all


Installing Kronolith
====================

Kronolith is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory.  The precise location of this directory will differ from system to
system.  Conventionally, Kronolith is installed directly underneath Horde in
the webserver's document tree.

Since Kronolith is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For
example, with the Apache webserver's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/kronolith-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv kronolith-x.y.z kronolith

and would then find Kronolith at the URL

   http://your-server/horde/kronolith/


Configuring Kronolith
=====================

1. Configuring Horde for Kronolith

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['kronolith']``
      stanza.  The ``show`` parameter should already be marked ``=> true``.
      If you have changed the location of Kronolith relative to Horde, either
      in the URL or in the filesystem or both, you must update the
      ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

2. Creating the database tables

   The specific steps to create the Kronolith database tables depend on which
   database you've chosen to use.

   First, look in ``scripts/sql/`` to see if a script already exists for your
   database type. If so, you should be able to simply execute that script as
   superuser in your database. (Note that executing the script as the "horde"
   user will probably fail when granting privileges.)

   If such a script does not exist, you'll need to build your own, using the
   file ``kronolith.sql`` as a starting point. If you need assistance in
   creating database tables, you may wish to let us know on the Kronolith
   mailing list.

   You will also need to make sure that the "horde" user in your database has
   table-creation privileges, so that the tables that `PEAR DB`_ uses to
   provide portable sequences can be created.

   .. _`PEAR DB`: http://pear.php.net/DB

3. Configuring Kronolith

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the configuration files in the
   ``config/`` directory can be found in each file.  You may edit these files
   if you wish to customize Kronolith's appearance and behavior.  The defaults
   will be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Kronolith.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to
   get to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration``
   icon to get the configuration page.  Select ``Calendar`` from the selection
   list of applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
   needed.  When done click on ``Generate Calendar Configuration`` to generate
   the ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions
   to the Kronolith configuration directory or file, it will not be able to
   write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one
   of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``kronolith/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Kronolith uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

4. Setting up reminder emails

   There are two kind of reminders sent to users, reminders on individual events
   with alarms, and daily agendas. Generally, if you set up cron jobs, you must
   have the PHP CLI installed (a CGI binary is not supported - ``php -v`` will
   report what kind of PHP binary you have).

   a. If you have not already set up the Horde Alarm system, you have to set up
      a cron entry for the Horde alarm script as documented in
      `horde/docs/INSTALL`_. This will send reminders for individual events.

   b. To send daily agendas, you must create a cron entry for
      ``kronolith/scripts/agenda.php``, and running the job once a day is
      recommended, e.g. at 2 a.m.::

         # Kronolith agenda
         0 2 * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/horde/kronolith/scripts/agenda.php

   Replace ``/usr/bin/php`` with the path to your PHP CLI and
   ``/var/www/horde/kronolith`` with the path to your Kronolith installation.

5. Testing Kronolith

   Use Kronolith to create, modify, and delete events. Test at least the
   following:

   - Creating a new event
   - Creating a recurring event
   - Modifying an event
   - Deleting an event
