------

[cjh] Allow all-day events and montly-on-weekday recurrence.
[cjh] Add a Horde summary API function.
[cjh] Use 24hr time preference (Jan Schneider <janmailing@gmx.de>).
[cjh] Added Preferences framework into Kronolith.
[jon] Merge doctype.inc into common-header.inc.
[jon] Allow the registry to handle Kronolith's configuration values.
[jon] HORDE_BASE is now defined in lib/base.php instead of config/conf.php.
[cjh] Define the HORDE_BASE constant in config/conf.php, and use it when
      referring to any of Horde's files.
[jon] Retired config/menu.txt in favor of config/menu.php.  This file follows
      a new format based on native PHP data structures.
[cjh] Add an optional keywords section, and a keywords definition file.
[cjh] Add a location field to events.

[cjh] Open the calender in base.php.
[cjh] Remove most of the remaining mcal-dependent code.
[cjh] Kronolith now uses Horde authentication instead of its own. This means
      that whatever auth method you are using for Horde will be used to
      authenticate to Kronolith, and in return you get single sign-on with any
      other apps using Horde authentication. This also means that Kronolith
      is completely independent of MCAL for authentication now; if you have
      one MCAL user, that's enough to provide calendars for all Horde users.
[cjh] Add lib/base.php to include all globally needed conf files and
      libraries, set up the language, etc.
[cjh] Abstract the event creation/edit code into the
      Kronolith_Driver/Kronolith_Event classes.
[cjh] Changes to work with register_globals = Off. (IN PROGRESS)
[cjh] Add an optional "get the time this event would start on day x" feature
      to the Kronolith_Event:: class, allowing status.php to work with
      recurring events.
[cjh] We now have the Kronolith_Event abstraction class that abstracts away
      details of events, so that the frontend scripts aren't dependant on
      mcal.
[cjh] Display events which are in progress, just starting, or start in under
      two hours along with other messages just under the menu.
[cjh] Much slicker UI.
[cjh] Use mcal_popen instead of mcal_open - might give us a performance gain.
