The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H4 (3.0.17).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, shared calendars, remote calendars, invitation management
(iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource management, alarms, recurring
events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of
overlapping events. For more information on Kronolith, visit
http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H4 (3.0.16) are:
    * Fixed XSS vulnerabilities in tasks and search views.
    * Updated Hungarian and Italian translations.
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.
