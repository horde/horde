The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first alpha release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H5 (4.2.0).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, CalDAV support, shared calendars, remote calendars,
invitation management (iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource
management, alarms, recurring events, and a sophisticated day/week view which
handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping events. For more information on
Kronolith, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
