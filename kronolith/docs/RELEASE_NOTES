The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H4 (3.0).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, shared calendars, remote calendars, invitation management
(iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource management, alarms, recurring
events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of
overlapping events.

To install Kronolith, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Kronolith with the following command:

  pear install horde/kronolith

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H4 (3.0-RC2) are:

    * Many small bugfixes and improvements.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H3 (2.3) are:

    * Updated for Horde 4.
    * New AJAX frontend with integrated tasks support.
    * New mobile frontend.
    * Resource scheduling.
    * System calendars.
    * Calendar coloring.
    * Calendar and event tagging.
    * Cross-timezone support.
    * CalDAV client support.
    * Improved recurring event exceptions.
    * Improved notification and invitation messages.
