The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H5 (4.0.0).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, shared calendars, remote calendars, invitation management
(iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource management, alarms, recurring
events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of
overlapping events. For more information on Kronolith, visit
http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is not feature complete yet and there are likely to be
bugs. You should not use this preview version with existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H4 (3.0) are:
    * Completely redesigned user interface.
    * Allowed to set individual timezones for events.
    * Added work week view to dynamic interface.
    * Added complete recurrence and exception editing to dynamic interface.
    * Added resource scheduling to dynamic interface.
    * Added quick task adding to dynamic interface.
    * Added heatmap to year view.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
