The Horde Team is pleased to announce the last beta release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H5 (4.0.0).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, shared calendars, remote calendars, invitation management
(iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource management, alarms, recurring
events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of
overlapping events. For more information on Kronolith, visit
http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is feature complete but there are likely to be bugs. You
should not use this preview version with existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H5 (4.0.0beta1) are:
    * Completed interface redesign.
    * Synchronized tags with Kolab categories.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
