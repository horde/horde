    <para>
    Kronolith is a web-based calendar application.  In addition to the
    required functions of creating, modifying, and deleting events, it
    currently supports recurring events (with exceptions and various deletion
    options), alarms, import and export functions (iCalendar and CSV formats),
    iCalendar invitations, multiple calendar views, shared calendars, display
    of Task List (Nag) tasks (if Tasks List is installed), and ability to show
    events in the Horde summary screen.

<entry id="alarms">
    <title>Alarms</title>
    <para>
    Kronolith can generate alarms for events in a calendar.  By default, the
    first alarm is generated fifteen minutes before the appointment is
    supposed to start, but the alarm can be set (per event) to occur at almost
    any interval before the event start time.
    </para>
</entry>

<entry id="recurring-events">
    <title>Recurring Events</title>
    <para>
    Events can be made to repeat in various ways. Many events repeat in
    certain frequently used ways. For example, the <i>Monthly</i> recurrence
    types make the selected item repeat each month and the <i>Weekly</i>
    recurrence type makes the selected item repeat each per week. These can be
    made to represent events that repeat in complex ways: for example, an item
    that occurs on the third Friday of each month, or an item that occurs on
    Monday, Wednesday, and Friday every week.
    </para>
    <para>
    You can also restrict how long an event repeats by selecting the <i>end
    date</i> for the event's recurrence.
    </para>
    <para>
    Normally, a modification to a repeating event applies to all occurrences
    of that event. A single occurrence of a repeating event can be modified by
    editing the occurrence, removing its recurrence information, and then
    choosing the <i>Save as New</i> option from the Repeat menu. The selected
    occurrence can now be modified independently of the other occurences.

<entry id="embed">
  <title>Embedding</title>
  <para>
    It is possible to embed small views of your calendars in external websites.
    You can embed the same views that you can place on Horde's portal page. The
    following are examples of code to use to embed each view on an external
    blog or website. You should obviously edit the code with the correct server
    address and calendar name.  The 'container' parameter is arbitrary, but must
    both match the DOM id of the the div element and be unique across the whole
    page you are embedding in.
  </para>

    To embed a small Month View of the current month:
