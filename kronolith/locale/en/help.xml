    <para>

    dialog. Enter your user name and password into the correct fields. Copy the

    dialog into the &quot;Server&quot; field. Copy the path of the URL to the

    &quot;/rpc/calendars/user/calendar:xyz/&quot; to the path field.
    </para>
</entry>

<entry id="menu-import-export">
    <title>Import/Export</title>
    <para>
    The &quot;Import/Export&quot; menu item in the basic mode, or the
    &quot;Import&quot; and &quot;Export&quot; tabs in the dynamic view allow
    you to import or export calendar events.  Depending on the mode you can
    currently import and export files in CSV, Microsoft Outlook, or
    vCalendar/iCalendar formats.
    </para>

<entry id="alarms">
    <title>Alarms</title>
    <para>
    Kronolith can generate alarms for events in a calendar. The alarm can be
    set (per event) to occur at almost any interval before the event start
    time.
    </para>
</entry>

<entry id="recurring-events">
    <title>Recurring Events</title>
    <para>
    Events can be made to repeat in various ways. Many events repeat in certain
    frequently used ways. For example, the &quot;Monthly&quot; recurrence types
    make the selected item repeat each month and the &quot;Weekly&quot;
    recurrence type makes the selected item repeat each week. These can be
    made to represent events that repeat in complex ways: for example, an item
    that occurs on the third Friday of each month, or an item that occurs on
    Monday, Wednesday, and Friday every week.
    </para>
    <para>
    You can also restrict how long an event repeats by selecting the end date
    or a recurrence count for the event's recurrence.
    </para>
    <para>
    Normally, a modification to a repeating event applies to all occurrences of
    that event. A single occurrence of a repeating event can be modified by
    editing the occurrence, removing its recurrence information, and then
    choosing the &quot;Save as New&quot; option from the Repeat menu. The
    selected occurrence can now be modified independently of the other
    occurences.
    </para>

<entry id="embed">
  <title>Embedding</title>
  <para>
    It is possible to embed small views of your calendars in external websites.
    You can embed the same views that you can place on Horde's portal page. The
    following are examples of code to use to embed each view on an external
    blog or website. You should obviously edit the code with the correct server
    address and calendar name.  The 'container' parameter is arbitrary, but must
    both match the DOM id of the div element and be unique across the whole
    page you are embedding in.
  </para>
  <para>
    To embed a small Month View of the current month:
  </para>
  <raw>
    &lt;div id=&quot;kronolithCal&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script
    src=&quot;http://hostname.example.com/horde/services/ajax.php/kronolith/embed?
    container=kronolithCal&amp;amp;view=Monthlist&quot;type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
  </raw>
  <para>
    To embed an Upcoming Events View (note the 'months' and 'maxevents'
    parameters):
  </para>
  <raw>
    &lt;div id=&quot;kronolist&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script
    src=&quot;http://hostname.example.com/horde/services/ajax.php/kronolith/embed?
    view=Monthlist&amp;calendar=calendar_name&amp;container=kronolist&amp;
    months=2&amp;maxevents=10&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
  </raw>
  <para>
    To embed a Summary View:

    &lt;div id=&quot;kronosummary&quot;&gt;

    src=&quot;http://hostname.example.com/horde/services/ajax.php/kronolith/embed?
