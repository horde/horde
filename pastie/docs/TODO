Pastie is working at a very basic level, especially for just keeping track of pastes.

Here is an incomplete list of features that would be cool to have.

* Use shares to allow personal pastebins
* Use share acls or permission system to seperate viewing ability from pasting/browsing ability
* Managing, Editing or Removing existing pastes
* Ajax interface
* Syntax Highlighted WYSIWYG

Thanks to Ben for creating a handy and lean app to expand upon.
