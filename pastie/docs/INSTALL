This document contains instructions for installing the Pastie pastebin application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Pastie, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Pastie distribution.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Pastie **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Pastie runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common
   tools for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Pastie.

   .. Important:: Pastie 1.0 requires version 5.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Pastie. Many of Pastie's prerequisites are
                  also Horde prerequisites. Additionally, many of Pastie's
                  optional features are configured via the Horde install.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/apps/horde

2. SQL support in PHP

   Pastie stores its data in a backend - currently only SQL database is
   supported.

   Build PHP with whichever SQL driver you require; see the Horde
   `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for more details on using databases with Horde.

3. Pear Text_Highlighter or LibGeshi
    Pastie needs either the Text_Highlighter Pear library or
    LibGeshi Generic Syntax Highlighter for syntax highlighting inside pastes

Installing Pastie
================

The **RECOMMENDED** way to install Pastie is using the PEAR installer.
Alternatively, if you want to run the latest development code or get the
latest not yet released fixes, you can install Pastie from Git.

Installing with PEAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First follow the instructions in `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ to prepare a PEAR
environment for Horde and install the Horde Framework.

When installing Pastie through PEAR now, the installer will automatically
install any dependencies of Pastie too. If you want to install Pastie
with all optional dependencies, but without the binary PECL packages that need
to be compiled, specify both the ``-a`` and the ``-B`` flag::

   pear install -a -B horde/pastie-alpha

By default, only the required dependencies will be installed::

   pear install horde/pastie-alpha

If you want to install Pastie even with all binary dependencies, you need to
remove the ``-B`` flag. Please note that this might also try to install PHP
extensions through PECL that might need further configuration or activation in
your PHP configuration::

   pear install -a horde/pastie-alpha

Installing from Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See http://www.horde.org/source/git.php


Configuring Pastie
=====================

1. Configuring Horde for Pastie

   Pastie requires an SQL backend for the Rdo storage driver.  If you didn't
   setup an SQL backend yet, go to the configuration interface, select Horde
   from the list of applications and select the ``Database`` tab.

2. Configuring Pastie

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the configuration
   of Pastie.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get to the
   administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to get the
   configuration page.  Select ``Inventory`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Inventory Configuration`` to generate the
   ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to the
   Pastie configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the
   file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the
   other methods to create the configuration file ``pastie/config/conf.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the other configuration files in
   the ``config/`` directory can be found in each file. You may create
   ``*.local.php`` versions of these files if you wish to customize Pastie's
   appearance and behavior. See the header of the configuration files for
   details and examples. The defaults will be correct for most sites.

3. Creating the database tables

   Once you finished the configuration in the previous step, you can create all
   database tables by clicking the ``DB schema is out of date.`` link in the
   Pastie row of the configuration screen.

   Alternatively creating the Pastie database tables can be accomplished with
   Horde's ``horde-db-migrate`` utility.  If your database is properly setup in
   the Horde configuration, just run the following::

      horde/bin/horde-db-migrate pastie

4. Testing Pastie

   Use Pastie to create, modify, and delete categories and stock. Test at least
   the following:

   - Creating a new property
   - Creating an inventory category
   - Creating an inventory stock item
   - Modifying an item
   - Deleting an item
