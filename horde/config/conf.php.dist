/**
 * Horde Configuration File
 *
 * This file contains intial configuration settings for Horde.
 * It contains basic settings that allow you to log into Horde and
 * complete the configuration with configuration interface. The first
 * change you should do is to select a sensible authentication driver
 * and administrator user name.
 *
 * The only settings that might need changes if you are not running
 * Horde in a "default" setup are documented below.
 *
 * Strings should be enclosed in 'quotes'.
 * Integers should be given literally (without quotes).
 * Boolean values may be true or false (never quotes).

// Determines how we generate full URLs (for location headers and

//   0 - Assume that we are not using SSL and never generate https URLS.
//   1 - Assume that we are using SSL and always generate https URLS.
//       NOTE: If you do this, you MUST hardcode the correct HTTPS port
//       number in $conf['server']['port'] below. Otherwise Horde will
//       be unable to generate correct HTTPS URLs when a user tries to
//       access Horde via a non-HTTPS port.
