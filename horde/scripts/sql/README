===================================
 Horde Database Installation Guide
===================================

:Contact:       horde@lists.horde.org


Purpose of this file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file will hopefully ease the installation and configuration of your
database for use with Horde.  The scope of the document deals primarily with
using your database with Horde and should not be considered a resource for
general database tasks.


Requirements for Horde
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Horde currently supports at least 7 databases:

    - MySQL         http://www.mysql.com/
    - PostgreSQL    http://www.postgresql.org/
    - Oracle        http://www.oracle.com/
    - Sybase        http://www.sybase.com/
    - SQLite        http://www.sqlite.org/
    - MS SQL        http://www.microsoft.com/sql/
    - MSDE          http://www.microsoft.com/sql/msde/

MySQL and PostgreSQL are regularly used by the development team, and will work
with no problems.  Oracle and SQLite support has been much improved recently
and works fine too.  Sybase was reported working in the previous version of
Horde/IMP by some of our users, and is assumed to still work... but that
hasn't been verified recently.


Before You Begin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to have your database preconfigured and working on your system
before you even get to this stage.  For help with this, please consult your
database specific help files.

Before using any of the scripts listed below, please look over them to ensure
that any system-specific settings (or personal choices) are set to your
desired settings (eg. ``username``, etc.).

In addition, if you create your own database user or change the
permissions for the ``horde`` user, you **MUST** ensure that the user
that Horde connects to the database as is able to create
tables. Otherwise Horde will be unable to create sequence tables for
tracking primary keys.

**PLEASE NOTE** that the database configuration steps listed below **MUST**
match what is configured within Horde.

Specifically, if you change the database name, user, or password while
configuring the database (below), you will need to make the same changes to
your Horde configuration files as well.


MySQL
~~~~~

The mysql_create.sql script will create a database called ``horde``, and a
user called ``horde`` (with password ``horde``) that has full rights to the
database.  *Note that with MySQL, PEAR DB emulates sequences by automatically
creating extra tables ending in _seq, so the MySQL ``horde`` user must have
``CREATE`` privilege on the ``horde`` database.

This script needs to be run as the MySQL root user (which is *NOT* the same as
the UNIX/Linux root user)::

  $ mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-passwd> < create.mysql.sql

After running this script, it's a good idea to restart your MySQL server::

  $ mysqladmin --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-passwd> reload

To check that this is working, the following command should connect without
errors::

  $ mysql --user=horde --password=horde horde

Type ``quit`` to quit MySQL.


PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~

  # su - postgres  (or whatever your database runs as... usually postgres)
  $ psql -d template1 -f create.pgsql.sql

This script will create a ``horde`` database and a ``horde`` user.  You should
set a password for this user with this command (if you didn't uncomment the
one in create.pgsql.sql)::

  $ psql -qc "ALTER USER horde WITH PASSWORD 'pass';" template1 postgres

Make sure to run any application SQL files as the ``horde`` user as well.


Oracle
~~~~~~

Run ``sqlplus``.  Login, then [we need instructions for creating the database
and user here].

That should be it.  Restart Oracle just to be sure, and try it.  Then create
the tables within the ``horde`` database::

[Also need those instructions here.]


Sybase
~~~~~~

To create the database, from ``isql`` run::

  create database horde

Next, you should (recommended) create a login to use with this database.  The
``isql`` command for this is::

  sp_addlogin <username> <password>

Next you need to change the ownership of the database to this new user.  The
``isql`` command for this is::

  sp_changedbowner <username>

After that, you just need to set up your tables within the database.  To do
that, just run this command from the command line::

  isql -i horde_users.sql -U<username> -P<password>
  isql -i horde_prefs.sql -U<username> -P<password>


MSDE 2000 (and possibly MS SQL Server)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create user and database, use the osql command::

  C:\>osql -U sa -P admin_password -S localhost -i create.msde.sql

Be sure to change the password for the horde user in the script file.  To
specify a particular instance of the SQL server use the
<servername>/<instance> for the -S flag.  If you aren't using mixed SQL
authentication, then you'll need to modify the script to associate the horde
user with a windows user account and run the script in the following manner as
the Administrator::

  C:\>osql -E -S localhost -i create.msde.sql

If you're having problems running this script on a SQL server on the network,
be sure the server is set up to allow network access.


Additional Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is by far not a complete HOWTO.  This is just a compiled list of what
people have contributed so far.  If you have tips, ideas, suggestions or
anything else that you think could help others in setting up their database
for use with Horde, please let us know.
