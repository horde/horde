# This is an example cron job shell script which will clean up any
# temporary files which may get stranded by Horde users in the
# webserver's temporary directory.
#
# You may have to change /tmp to another location depending on your
# configuration.  Other modifications may also be required.
#
# This script is provided as-is and is to be used at your own risk.
# Horde and the authors accept no responsibility for any damages or
# loses caused by this script whether indirect, incidental, or
# consequential,  whether or not such damages could be forseen.
#
# How to use this script will depend on your system.  For some systems,
# it is as simply as putting this file in the /etc/cron.daily directory.
# For others, more or different setup will be required.  See the
# documentation for your systems job scheduler for more information.
