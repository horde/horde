The steps to use when cutting a new release
===========================================

1. Examine ``*/docs/CHANGES`` files:

   - Add the word SECURITY in front of any security-related changes,
     and move them to the top, to draw attention to them.

   - Cull out the most important ones, and prepare the text of an
     announcement.

   - Write the release announcements into the ``docs/RELEASE_NOTES`` file and
     check if it parses with ``php -l docs/RELEASE_NOTES``.

   As an extra effort to ensure completeness, you could also check the
   changelogs for any changes that may not have been inserted in the
   ``*/docs/CHANGES`` file and integrate them into the above points.

2. Examine ``docs/*`` files, and update the version if this is a major
   release. Minor releases should not change the versions in these files.

   Add ``-alpha`` or ``-beta`` sentinels to the ``pear install`` instructions
   if switching from stable release to pre-release, and vice versa.

3. Update the .pot file: ``horde-translation extract --module foo`` and commit
   it.

4. Make sure your settings in ``components/config/conf.php`` are correct.

5. Make a "dry run" of the ``horde-components`` script by adding ``--pretend``
   to the command line parameters.

6. Create the PEAR package releases using ``horde-components ./foo release``::

   - For usage, use the ``--help`` flag.

7. Commit the web site (``horde-web`` Git repository):

   - ``config/versions.sqlite`` contains the updated version information.

8. Add new version to bugs.horde.org if not added automatically by the release
   script.

   If releasing the first stable version after a release cycle, mark all
   pre-release versions as inactive.

9. Bump version numbers of showstopper tickets that didn't go into the release,
   then bump version number in the showstopper query on bugs.horde.org.


Guidelines for release cycles
=============================

* When switching between stable and unstable releases, make sure the release
  state and release version in package.xml are correct.

* During unstable releases the release version must be checked for every
  release, because the components scripts does automatically bump versions, but
  doesn't switch versions when changing from alpha to beta to RC.

* During unstable releases check carefully the dependency versions. It may be
  necessary to set an alpha/beta/RC version as the minimum version of a
  dependency.
