This document contains instructions for installing the Horde Framework on your
system.

The Horde Framework, by itself, does not provide any significant end user
functionality; it provides a base for other applications and tools for
developers. When you have installed Horde as described below, you will
probably want to install some of the available Horde applications, such as
IMP_ (a webmail client), or Kronolith_ (a calendar). There is a list of Horde
applications and projects at http://www.horde.org/projects.php.

If you are interested in developing applications for Horde, there is developer
documentation and references available at http://dev.horde.org/, and some
tutorials and papers on Horde available at http://www.horde.org/papers/.

For information on the capabilities and features of Horde, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Horde distribution.

Quick Install
=============

These are very terse instructions how to install Horde and its prerequisites
on a LAMP sytem.  They are addressed to experienced administrators who know
exactly what they are doing.  For more detailed instructions, start reading
below at Prerequisites_.

1. Compiling PHP for Apache::

     cd php-x.x.x/
     ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs \
                 --with-gettext --enable-mbstring --with-gd \
                 --with-png-dir=/usr --with-jpeg-dir=/usr \
                 [--with-mysql|--with-pgsql|--with-oci8|--with-ldap]
                 [--with-mcrypt] [--with-tidy]
     make
     make install

2. Restart Apache.

3. Register Horde PEAR channel::

     pear channel-discover pear.horde.org

4. Set Horde installation directory::

     pear install horde/horde_role
     pear run-scripts horde/horde_role

5. Install Horde::

     pear install horde/horde

5. Configure Horde::

     cd config/
     cp conf.php.dist conf.php

6. Finish configuration::

     http://your-server/horde/

   Go to Administration => Configuration => Horde
   (Or navigate to http://your-server/horde/admin/config)

7. Create database tables::

     cd ..
     ./bin/db_migrate

8. Test Horde

   Enable the test script in the Horde configuration at the ``General`` in the
   ``PHP Settings`` section, or edit ``horde/config/conf.php`` and set
   ``'testdisable'`` to false.

   Go to::

     http://your-server/horde/test.php

   .. Important:: Disable the test script again after you are done.


Prerequisites
=============

The following prerequisites are **REQUIRED** for Horde to function properly.

1. A webserver that supports PHP.

   Horde is primarily developed under the Apache and Lighttpd webservers,
   which we recommend.  These servers are available from:

      http://httpd.apache.org/
      http://www.lighttpd.net/

2. PHP 5.2.0 or above.

   PHP is the interpreted language in which Horde is written.

   If possible, you should install PHP with your operating system's package
   manager. Alternatively you build PHP yourself.

   To build PHP from sources, you can obtain it at

      http://www.php.net/

   Follow the instructions in the PHP package to build PHP for your system. If
   you use Apache, be sure to build PHP as a library with one of the following
   options::

       --with-apache
       --with-apxs
       --with-apxs2

   options to ``./configure``, and not as a standalone executable.

   The following PHP extensions respective options are **REQUIRED** by Horde
   (listed with their own prerequisites and configure options). In many cases,
   the required libraries and tools can be obtained as packages from your
   operating system vendor.

   a. Gettext support. ``--with-gettext``

      Gettext is the GNU Translation Project's localization library.
      Horde uses gettext to provide local translations of text displayed by
      applications. Information on obtaining the gettext package is available
      at

         http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html

      See also note below on configuring Translations_.

   b. XML and DOM support.

      XML and DOM support are enabled in PHP 5 by default. You only have to
      make sure that you do **not** use ``--disable-dom``,
      ``--disable-simplexml``, or ``--disable-xml``.

      Make sure you are using a newer version of libxml.  Older version of
      libxml (e.g. 2.6.26) have been reported to be partially broken when
      handling certain charsets.

   The following PHP options are **RECOMMENDED** to enable advanced features in
   Horde:

   a. File Upload Support

      File upload support is **REQUIRED** by many applications to allow
      advanced features to work. To enable file upload support:

          1. In your php.ini file, the following line **must** be present::

                file_uploads = On

          2. Your temporary upload directory **must** be writable to the user
             the web server is running as.  If you leave the configuration
             option ``upload_tmp_dir`` blank in ``php.ini``, PHP will use the
             default directory compiled into it (normally ``/tmp`` on
             Unix-like systems).

          3. Set the maximum size of the uploaded files via the
             ``upload_max_filesize`` configuration option in ``php.ini``.  For
             example, to allow 5 MB attachments, place the following line in
             your ``php.ini`` file::

                upload_max_filesize = 5M

       If either ``file_uploads`` is turned off, or your temporary upload
       directory is *not* writable by the server, all file upload
       functionality will be disabled by Horde and will not be available to
       the user.

       See the `File Uploads`_ FAQ entry for further information.

   b. A preferences container.

      Horde applications can store user preferences in an SQL database, an
      LDAP directory, an IMSP server, a Kolab server, or in PHP sessions.

      For SQL database preferences storage, Horde is thoroughly tested on
      MySQL(i) (``--with-mysql(i)``) and PostgreSQL (``--with-pgsql``), and
      has been reported to work with SQLite (enabled by default), Oracle
      (``--with-oci8``) and SQL Server (``--with-mssql``).  It may also work
      with any other database supported by PEAR, but they are untested.

      Preferences can also be stored via LDAP (``--with-ldap``), Kolab
      (``--with-ldap``), and IMSP.

      Alternatively, preferences can be stored in PHP sessions, which
      requires no external programs or configure options, but which will not
      maintain preferences between sessions.

      While the LDAP, database, Kolab, or IMSP server need not be running on
      the machine onto which you are installing Horde, the appropriate
      client libraries to access the server must be available locally.

      If a preference container is not configured, no preference options
      will be configurable via Horde's web interface - the default values
      stored in each applications ``config/prefs.php`` file will be used.

   c. UTF-8 support ``--enable-mbstring``

      If these extensions are enabled, Horde can better support
      multibyte character sets like UTF-8.

      For iconv support you should use the GNU libiconv library, which is more
      stable and supports more charsets, compared to other iconv
      implementations, like Solaris', for example.

      Iconv support is enabled by default in PHP 5. You only have to make sure
      that you do **not** use ``--without-iconv``

   d. GD support ``--with-gd``

      Horde will use the GD extension to perform manipulations on image data
      through the Horde_Image library.

      If you want GD to be able to work with PNG images, you should use the
      ``--with-png-dir`` option to make sure PHP can find the PNG libraries
      it needs to compile.

      If you want GD to be able to work with JPEG images, you should use the
      ``--with-jpeg-dir`` option to make sure PHP can find the JPEG libraries
      it needs to compile.

      You can also use the ImageMagick_ package to do these manipulations
      instead.  See the ``Image Manipulation`` tab of the Horde configuration
      for more details.

      .. _ImageMagick: http://www.imagemagick.org

   e. tidy ``--with-tidy``

      The tidy PHP extension is required to sanitize HTML data.

   The following PHP options are **OPTIONAL** to enable advanced features in
   Horde:

   a. Mcrypt support ``--with-mcrypt``

      Mcrypt is a general-purpose cryptography library which is more efficient
      than using native PHP-based encryption.  If available, mcrypt is used to
      encrypt/decrypt the authentication credentials stored within the
      session.  Mcrypt can be obtained from:

         http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/

   .. Important:: Additionally, individual Horde applications may **REQUIRE**
                  or **RECOMMEND** other options to be built into PHP
                  also. Please check ``docs/INSTALL`` for all applications you
                  wish to use to see if other PHP options are needed.


3. PEAR Modules

   PEAR is short for "PHP Extension and Application Repository".  The goal of
   PEAR is to provide a means of distributing reusable code.

   For more information, see http://pear.php.net/

   .. Important:: Make sure you are running a supported (i.e. new enough)
                  version of PEAR: use the test script described below under
                  "`Configuring Horde`_".  Do **not** use the PEAR version
                  from ftp.horde.org.

   Check that the path where the PEAR packages are installed are part of the
   ``include_path`` parameter that PHP uses to find PEAR packages.

   Run the command::

     pear config-show

   You will see something like::

     PEAR directory   php_dir   /usr/share/php

   Now open the php.ini file of your system, for example ``/etc/php.ini``,
   find the ``include_path`` and make sure that ``/usr/share/php`` is part of
   the list.  If you had to change that value, restart the web server after
   saving ``php.ini``.

   If you are going to install Horde the recommended way, i.e. using the PEAR
   installer, you can skip the remainder of this section. Installing Horde
   through PEAR will automatically download and install all required PEAR
   modules.

   These PEAR modules are **REQUIRED** to be installed for complete Horde
   functionality:

   a. Crypt_Blowfish (>= 1.0.1)

      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pear install Crypt_Blowfish

   These PEAR modules are **RECOMMENDED** to be installed:

   a. Date

      **REQUIRED** only if you are dealing with calendar data.
      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pear install Date

   b. DB (>= 1.7.8)

      **REQUIRED** as soon as you want or need to store anything in a database.
      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pear install DB

   c. File

      **REQUIRED** only if you wish to import CSV files.
      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pear install File

   d. HTTP_WebDAV_Server

      **REQUIRED** only if you want to use Horde's WebDAV interface, for
      example to access calendars, tasklists or files with an external client.
      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pear install HTTP_WebDAV_Server-beta

   e. Net_DNS

      If installed, it will be used instead of the built-in PHP function
      gethostbyaddr() for host name lookups. This has the advantage that
      Net_DNS has configurable timeouts and retries. Net_DNS requires the
      ``mhash`` PHP extension.
      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pear install Net_DNS

   f. Services_Weather (>= 1.3.1)

      **REQUIRED** only if you wish to use the weather.com block on the portal
      page.
      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pear install Services_Weather

      Additional steps are required if you want use the METAR weather block on
      the portal page. See the file ``data/Services_Weather/buildMetarDB.php``
      in your PEAR directory for details.

   g. File_Fstab

     Required only if you use the localhost driver for the Accounts block.
     To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

       pear install File_Fstab

   This method of installing PEAR modules requires that you have a PHP version
   that has been compiled as a static binary.  All versions of PHP build both
   both a SAPI module (Apache, CGI, etc.) and a command-line (CLI) binary.
   Check if you have a php binary in ``/usr/local/bin`` (``/usr/bin`` if you
   installed from an operating system package) before recompiling.

   For more detailed directions on installing PEAR modules, see the PEAR
   documentation at http://pear.php.net/manual/

4. PECL Modules

   PECL is short for "PHP Extension Community Library".  The goal of PECL is
   to provide a means of easily distributing PHP extensions.

   For more information, see http://pecl.php.net/

   PECL is the "sister" of PEAR and uses the same packaging and distribution
   system as PEAR, so the configuration/setup is essentially identical to the
   PEAR instructions above.

   When you install a PECL extension, you have to add it to your ``php.ini``
   so it gets loaded.  Add the following line to your ``php.ini`` file to load
   the extension (the extension should be installed in the directory specified
   by the ``extension_dir`` option in ``php.ini``)::

     extension=fileinfo.so

   Or on Windows::

     extension=fileinfo.dll

   After that, restart your webserver.

   These PECL modules are **RECOMMENDED** to be installed:

   a. fileinfo

      Allows Horde modules to guess the MIME type of files by analyzing
      their contents.

      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pecl install fileinfo

      .. As of PHP 5.3.0, this module is automatically enabled by default.

   b. memcache

      If using memcache, the memcache PECL extension must be installed.

      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pecl install memcache

   c. lzf

      If the lzf module is available, Horde can compress cached data within
      the current session, thus reducing the size of the current session.

      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pecl install lzf

   d. idn

      The idn module is required to handle display of Internationalized Domain
      Names (see RFC 3490), e.g in e-mail addresses.

      To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

        pecl install idn

   For additional help on using the pear command-line program to install PECL
   extensions, see the PEAR installation section above.


The following non-PHP prerequisites are **RECOMMENDED**, or are **REQUIRED**
if you use a specific Horde application (as noted in [brackets]):

1. Sendmail or equivalent.

   Horde uses sendmail, or a program that implements the ``sendmail(8)`` API
   (as included with postfix, qmail, and exim, among others). If your system
   does not already have a full mail transport with a sendmail interface, you
   can configure Horde to speak directly with a remote SMTP server.

2. aspell - Spelling Checker

   Aspell, a comand-line program, is used as Horde's spell-checking engine.
   You must install and configure aspell to use Horde's spell-check feature.

   Version 0.60 or higher is REQUIRED.

   You can obtain aspell from:

      http://aspell.sourceforge.net/


Installing Horde
================

There are several ways to install Horde. The recommended way to install Horde
is using the PEAR installer. Alternatively it can be installed from
tarballs. Finally, if you want to run the latest development code, or get the
latest, not yet released, fixes, you can install Horde from Git.


Installing with PEAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First you need to register the Horde PEAR channel server to your local PEAR
system. This has to be done only **once** ever on a single PEAR system::

   pear channel-discover pear.horde.org

Next install a so-called "role" for Horde. This role defines where Horde is
supposed to be installed. This should be a directory in your web server's web
root, e.g. ``/var/www/horde``. Again this has to be done only **once** ever on
a single PEAR system::

   pear install horde/role
   pear run-scripts horde/horde_role

When installing Horde through PEAR now, the installer will automatically
install any dependencies of Horde too. By default, only the required
dependencies will be installed::

   pear install horde/horde

If you want to install Horde even with all optional dependencies, you need to
specify the ``-a`` flag. Please note that this might also try to install PHP
extensions through PECL that might need further configuration or activation in
your PHP configuration::

   pear install -a horde/horde

If you want to create a separate PEAR installation for installing Horde,
independent from the system-wide PEAR installation, this can be done with the
following commands. The paths are only examples of course::

   mkdir /var/www/horde
   pear config-create /var/www/horde /var/www/horde/pear.conf
   pear -c /var/www/horde/pear.conf install pear

Then follow the regular installation steps, but use the ``pear`` command from
the PEAR installation you just created, e.g.::

   /var/www/horde/pear/pear -c /var/www/horde/pear.conf channel-discover pear.horde.org

Finally create a .htaccess file in ``/var/www/horde/`` or configure your web
server in some other way to point PHP's ``include_path`` setting to the PEAR
installation and the ``PHP_PEAR_SYSCONF_DIR`` environment variable to the web
root::

   php_value include_path /var/www/horde/pear/php
   SetEnv PHP_PEAR_SYSCONF_DIR /var/www/horde


Installing from Release Tarballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/horde/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

Or, better yet, use a mirror that is closer to you.  The mirror list can be
found at:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

The FTP directory contains the Horde PHP files which can be unpacked using
``tar`` and ``gunzip`` (see `Installing Horde`_, below).

Bleeding-edge development versions of Horde and its applications are available
via Git; see the file `docs/HACKING`_, or visit the website
http://www.horde.org/source/, for information on accessing the Horde Git
repository.

You will probably also want one or more Horde applications, since Horde
doesn't do much by itself; a list of available applications, with links to
descriptions and downloads, can be found at

   http://www.horde.org/projects.php

While previous versions of Horde were numbered to correspond with a particular
version of the IMP webmail application, that is no longer true as of Horde
version 2.0. The current version of Horde will work with the current version
of Horde applications. For more information about which versions are
compatible see http://www.horde.org/source/versions.php.

Horde is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system. If
you have no idea where you should be installing Horde, install it directly
under the root of your webserver's document tree.

Since Horde is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the
URL. Please note that the default configuration expects Horde to be installed
in the directory ``/horde`` though. For example, with the Apache webserver's
default document root of ``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs
   tar zxvf /path/to/horde-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv horde-x.y.z horde

You would then find Horde at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/


Installing from Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See::

   http://horde.org/source/git.php


Configuring Horde
=================

1. Configuring the web server

   Horde requires the following webserver settings. Examples shown are for
   Apache; other webservers' configurations will differ.

   a. PHP interpretation for files matching ``*.php``::

         AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

      .. Note:: The above instructions may not work if you have specified PHP
                as an output filter with ``SetOutputFilter`` directive in
                Apache 2.x versions.  In particular, Red Hat 8.0 and above
                Apache 2.x RPMS have the output filter set, and **MUST NOT**
                have the above ``AddType`` directive added.

   b. ``index.php`` as an index file (brought up when a user requests a URL for
      a directory)::

         DirectoryIndex index.php

2. Configuring Horde

   To configure Horde, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and copy the ``conf.php.dist`` configuration file to
   ``conf.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the configuration files in the
   ``config/`` directory can be found in each file. The defaults will be
   correct for most sites. If you wish to customize Horde's appearance and
   behavior, create "local" files for the configuration file you want to
   change. For example if you want to change the default value and lock a
   preference, create a ``config/prefs.local.php` file with the following
   content::

      <?php
      $_prefs['prefname']['value'] = 'somedefault';
      $_prefs['prefname']['locked'] = true;

   This works analogous with any other configuration file.

   .. Warning:: All configuration files in Horde are PHP scripts that are
                executed by the web server. If you make an error in one of
                these files, Horde might stop working. Thus it is always a good
                idea to test the configuration files after you edited them. If
                you want to test mime_drivers.local.php for example run::

                   php -l mime_drivers.local.php

3. Completing Configuration

   You can now access Horde without a password, and you will be logged in as
   an administrator.

   .. Important:: You should first configure a real authentication
                  backend and designate which accounts in your real
                  backend will be administrator accounts.  Horde does
                  **NOT** have a default administrator account - all
                  users, including administrators, must exist in the
                  actual authentication backend.  Click on ``Configuration``
                  in the ``Administration`` menu and configure Horde.
                  Start in the ``Authentication`` tab.

   Here is an example for configuring authentication against a remote IMAP
   server.  Similar steps apply for authenticating against a database, an LDAP
   server, etc.

   a. In the ``Which users should be treated as administrators`` field enter a
      comma separated list of user names of your choosing. This will control
      who is allowed to make configuration changes, see passwords, potentially
      add users, etc.

   b. In the ``What backend should we use for authenticating users to Horde``
      pulldown menu select ``IMAP authentication``. The page will reload and
      you will have specific options for IMAP authentication.

   c. In the ``Configuration type`` pulldown menu select ``Separate values``.
      The page will reload with additional options. Fill in the remaining
      three fields appropriately:

      - IP name/number of the IMAP server
      - For a secure connection, select port 993.
      - Select the secure connection protocol to use, if desired.

   Continue to configure Horde through all the tabs of the configuration
   interface and click on ``Generate Horde Configuration``. An important item
   that you probably want to configure is the ``Database Settings``, which
   defines the database configuration that is used, by default, for several
   different Horde sub-systems.

   .. Important:: By default Horde will be using database backends for most
                  sub-systems. If you do not plan to use a database with Horde,
                  you need to go through all tabs of the configuration screen
                  and change the configuration for those systems from ``SQL``
                  to a suitable alternative.

   Configuration of applications in ``registry.php`` is documented in the
   ``INSTALL`` file of each application.  Most applications require you to
   configure them with a "Horde administrator" account.  A Horde administrator
   account is any normal Horde account that has been added to the administrator
   list in the ``Authentication`` tab of the Horde configuration.

   The other files in that directory need only be modified if you wish to
   customize Horde's appearance or behaviour -- the defaults will work at most
   sites.

4. Creating databases

   Once you created the database configuration in the previous step, you can
   create all database tables by hitting the ``Update all DB schemas`` button
   in the configuration screen.

   Please note that this requires the database that you entered in the database
   configuration to already exist, and the configured database user to have
   sufficient permissions to create new tables in this database.

   Alternatively you can run the ``bin/db_migrate`` script in the Horde
   directory from the command line.

   TODO: Update documentation once db_migrate takes (super-) user credentials
   as command line flags.

5. Setting up alarm emails

   If you want your users to be able to receive emails from the Horde_Alarm
   system, you must set up a cron entry for ``horde/bin/alarms.php``, you
   must have at least one administrator specified in the Horde configuration,
   and you must have the PHP CLI installed (a CGI binary is not supported -
   ``php -v`` will report what kind of PHP binary you have).

   Running the job every 5 minutes is recommended::

      # Horde Alarms
      */5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/horde/bin/alarms.php

   (replace ``/usr/bin/php`` with the path to your PHP CLI and
   ``/var/www/horde/`` with the path to your Horde installation)

6. Testing Horde

   Once you have configured your webserver, PHP, and Horde, bring up the
   included test page in your Web browser to ensure that all necessary
   prerequisites have been met. If you installed Horde as described above, the
   URL to the test page would be::

      http://your-server/horde/test.php

   The test script is disabled by default for security reasons. To enable
   set the 'testdisable' configuration option to false. After testing is
   completed, the testdisable option should be reset to true.

   Check that your PHP and PEAR versions are acceptably recent, that all
   required module capabilities are present, and that ``magic_quotes_runtime``
   is set to ``Off``. Then note the ``Session counter: 1`` line under ``PHP
   Sessions``, and reload the page. The session counter should increment.

   If you get a warning like ``Failed opening '/path/to/test.php' for
   inclusion``, make sure that the web server has the permission to read the
   ``test.php`` file.

7. Securing Horde

   a. Passwords

      Some of Horde's configuration files contain passwords which local users
      could use to access your database.  It is recommended to ensure that at
      least the Horde configuration files (in ``config/``) are not readable to
      system users.  There are ``.htaccess`` files restricting access to
      directories that do not need to be accessed directly; before relying on
      those, ensure that your webserver supports ``.htaccess`` and is
      configured to use them, and that the files in those directories are in
      fact inaccessible via the browser.

      An additional approach is to make Horde's configuration files owned by
      the user ``root`` and by a group which only the webserver user belongs
      to, and then making them readable only to owner and group.  For example,
      if your webserver runs as ``www.www``, do as follows::

         chown root.www config/*
         chmod 0440 config/*

   b. Sessions

      Session data -- including hashed versions of your users' passwords, in
      some applications -- may not be stored as securely as necessary.

      If you are using file-based PHP sessions (which are the default), be
      sure that session files are not being written into ``/tmp`` with
      permissions that allow other users to read them. Ideally, change the
      ``session.save_path`` setting in ``php.ini`` to a directory only
      readable and writeable by your webserver.

      Additionally, you can change the session handler of PHP to use any
      storage backend requested (e.g. SQL database) via the ``Custom Session
      Handler`` tab in the Horde configuration.

   For more information about securing your webserver, PHP and Horde, see the
   `docs/SECURITY`_ file.


Configuring Applications
========================

A list of available Horde applications can be found at

   http://www.horde.org/projects.php

Instructions on configuring Horde applications can be found in the ``INSTALL``
file in the application's ``docs/`` directory.


Temporary Files
===============

Various Horde applications will generate temporary files in PHP's temporary
directory (see the ``General`` tab in the Horde configuration).  For various
reasons, some of these files may not be removed when the user's session
ends. To reclaim this disk space, it may be necessary to periodically delete
these old temporary files.

An example cron-based solution can be found at ``scripts/temp-cleanup.cron``.
Another possible solution is to use Red Hat's ``tmpwatch`` utility or anything
similar to remove old files (see http://www.redhat.com/).

Stale sessions are automatically pruned by PHP according to the
`session.gc_probability`_, `session.gc_divisor`_, and
`session.gc_maxlifetime`_ settings located in ``php.ini``. However, the
default settings are very aggressive: the garbage collection routine runs on
average 1% of the time a page is loaded. For most installations, a lower
garbage collection rate is recommended (setting session.gc_divisor to 10,000
or higher is much more reasonable).


Translations
============

Note for international users: Horde uses GNU gettext to provide local
translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found in
the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your locale (and
you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or if you're having
trouble using a provided translation, please see the
`horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.
