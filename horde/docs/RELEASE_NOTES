The Horde Team is pleased to announce the 5th beta release of the Horde
Application Framework version 5.0.0.

The Horde Application Framework is a flexible, modular, general-purpose web
application framework written in PHP. It provides an extensive array of
components that are targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in
developing modern web applications. It is the basis for a large number of
production-level web applications, notably the Horde Groupware suites. For more
information on Horde or the Horde Groupware suites, visit http://www.horde.org.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is not feature complete yet and there are likely to be
bugs. You should not use this preview version with existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

For upgrading instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/horde/docs/UPGRADING

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/horde/docs/INSTALL

The major changes compared to the Horde version 5.0.0beta4 are:
    * More interface improvements.
    * Small bugfixes.
