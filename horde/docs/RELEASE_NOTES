The Horde Team is pleased to announce the second release candidate of the Horde
Application Framework version 5.2.0.

The Horde Application Framework is a flexible, modular, general-purpose web
application framework written in PHP. It provides an extensive array of
components that are targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in
developing modern web applications. It is the basis for a large number of
production-level web applications, notably the Horde Groupware suites. For more

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Horde 5.2.0.  We encourage
widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug tracking

before the final release.
