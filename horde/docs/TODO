 Horde Development TODO List
=============================

:Contact:       horde@lists.horde.org

In no particular order:

- Add a /services/groups/ section. Include public group homepages, including
  any information marked public for the group (let the members list be marked
  public/group only/admin only), add group administrators (just a flag for
  users), add the ability to show all calendars/other shares that a group has
  permissions to, allow creating a new calendar/poll/etc. for a group.

- Add the ability to break out DataTree group_uids into their own tables (one
  table per group).

- Use the freedesktop shared-mime-info_ XML file to build our MIME_Magic magic
  data files.

- Add UI support for more configuration files.

- Show shared preferences on all prefs summary screens to make it
  easier for user to find global preferences.
