Hacking on Horde from CVS
=========================

Horde and its modules use CVS for source control.  CVS is well-documented, but
the manual page assumes you already know how it works.  An excellent guide to
getting started with CVS is "Open Source Development with CVS" by Karl Fogel.
It's published by Coriolis, and the technical part of the book is available
for free on the Web at

   http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/

The paper version includes chapters on organizing and managing Open Source
development.  You can obtain a CVS client for your operating system at
CVSHOME, at

   http://www.cvshome.org/downloads.html

of them may be found at http://www.cyclic.com - they support CVS commercially,
even though it is an open source program.

You will need a CVS client to do any of the following (check out the Cyclic
homepage if you don't have one).

For those already familiar with CVS, the anonymous CVSROOT is::

   :pserver:cvsread@anoncvs.horde.org:/repository


Downloading Horde modules from CVS
----------------------------------

You will want to do this if you want bleeding edge code.

1. Go to the directory you want to download the code to::

      cd ~/work

2. Set ``CVSROOT`` to the location of the CVS repository.  You could also pass
   cvs the name of the CVS root with the ``-d`` option.  Be sure to note the
   colon ``:`` in front of ``pserver``.

   (in sh, ksh, bash, zsh)::

      CVSROOT=:pserver:cvsread@anoncvs.horde.org:/repository
      export CVSROOT

   (in csh, tcsh)::

      setenv CVSROOT :pserver:cvsread@anoncvs.horde.org:/repository

3. Login to the anonymous CVS repository.  When prompted for a password, enter
   ``horde``::

      cvs login

4. Check out the module you want to download from the repository.  Replace
   ``MODULE`` with horde, imp, turba and so forth.  (The ``-z3`` tells
   cvs to compress the data it sends over the network, uncompressing it when
   you ????::

      cvs -z3 co MODULE

   If you want to check out a particular branch of a module (for example, the
   ``RELENG_3`` branch of IMP), include the branch tag like so, replacing
   ``TAG`` with the name of the branch::

      cvs -z3 co -r TAG MODULE

5. As you work with the software, you can periodically update your tree to
   match the master tree at any time, from the top directory of the
   module.  Using ``horde`` as an example module::

      cd ~/work/horde
      cvs -z3 update


Obtaining a CVS account
-----------------------

If you're going to be a regular contributor to Horde, then you can request a
CVS account in order to commit your changes to the repository yourself.  (If
you're only going to be contributing once in a while, there truly is no need
for you to have one, as posting your changes to the application's mailing list
will suffice to get your changes reviewed and included.)

If you do get commit access to the CVS tree, you will have the ability to mess
some things up.  Not for good, mind you, as CVS allows updates to be backed
off, but you still need to remember what you're doing and be careful what you
commit and when you commit it.  Because of this, we prefer that you submit
your work to the mailing list for a while so we can tell you know what you're
doing.

If you're not a committer, the best way to submit a patch is to send it either
to the application's mailing list or to dev@lists.horde.org.  For more
information on Horde mailing lists, see

   http://www.horde.org/mail/


Committing changes to CVS
-------------------------

Once you have a CVS account, you will need to log into the CVS server so it
knows who you are and can grant you the appropriate rights to work on the
sources.

The ``CVSROOT`` is different for committers; instead of the repository listed
above, set ``CVSROOT`` to::

   :ext:USERNAME@cvs.horde.org:/repository

replacing ``USERNAME`` with your cvs username.

The committers' repository does not use pserver.  You will need to have ssh
installed on your system, and have arranged with one of the core developers to
put your SSH key on the system.  If you have not done this, talk to one of the
core developers.

To get cvs to use ssh, you will need to set the environment variable
``CVS_RSH`` to ``ssh`` in your shell.

You do not need to do ``cvs login``; you will be prompted for the passphrase
for your SSH key whenever you access the repository.

You may also wish to set the environment variable ``EDITOR`` to point to your
favorite text editor. This way when you commit software changes and it asks
you to enter a change description, you can do so in your favorite editor.

Then, for work on developmental, bleeding-edge versions:

1) Check out the code by typing ``cvs co MODULE``
2) Work on the code <hack, hack, hack>
3) Commit any changes with ``cvs commit FILENAMES`` in the directory the files
   are in.

Sometimes, others will make changes and you will need to update your tree so
the changes show up in your local sources.  You do this with the ``cvs
update`` command in the horde directory.  Please be sure to update your tree
regularly; merging changes is considerably more work than running ``cvs
update``.

To work with any tagged branch (to patch a stable release, for instance):

1) Check out the code with ``cvs co -r TAG MODULE``
2) Work on the code <hack, hack, hack>
3) Commit any changes with ``cvs commit FILENAMES`` in the directory the files
   are in.

If somebody else also makes changes to the labeled version, you can get them
in your local source tree with the ``cvs update`` command issued in the module
directory.

If you are done working with the labeled source branch, and would like to move
back into the bleeding-edge development source tree, you can issue the command
``cvs update -A`` to update everything to the current ``HEAD`` version.

(We used to document how to merge code from HEAD into a labeled branch here,
but since it was heavily peppered with "talk to core developers first", it's
been elided to prevent errors of experimentation.  If you think you need to do
that, you have to talk to core developers anyhow -- they'll explain how.)


Other CVS Notes
---------------

If you do end up getting a CVS account, here are some tips to help keep things
going smoothly:

1. Subscribe to the cvs@lists.horde.org and dev@lists.horde.org mailing lists.

2. Be sure to modify the file ``docs/CHANGES`` to reflect the changes to the
   code you are committing.

3. If you're planning on doing anything major, please let people know in
   advance on the dev@ or application mailing lists as appropriate.

   Developers need to communicate extensively in order to make sure everyone
   knows what's going on.  This is extremely important when you work on key
   components.

4. Use the Bug Tracking System on http://bugs.horde.org.  All new submissions
   are being cc'd to the bugs@lists.horde.org mailing list so that if we aren't
   paying attention, we'll at least get mail about it.  Using the Bugs
   database helps us keep track of issues we are having and where we stand
   with the product.

5. Remember to advance the library version whenever anything major is changed.
