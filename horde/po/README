Translation Tool
================

``translation.php`` is a small PHP script that should help translators doing
their work.

Any feedback, bug reports and feature requests should be send to the `i18n
mailing list`_. This is also the right place for new translations and general
discussions of i18n and l10n questions and problems.

``translation.php`` is located in ``horde/po``, so you will have to make
``horde/po`` your working directory in order to run the commands quoted
below. But you can run the script from any directory, just adapt the directory
to the script. See _Prerequisites if your PHP binary is not located in
``/usr/bin/php``.

For a list of available commands run::

  ./translation.php help

For detailed help on a certain command run::

  ./translation.php help command

Additional information about creating translations and fixing problems can be
found in the file ``horde/docs/TRANSLATION``.

.. _i18n mailing list: http://www.horde.org/mail/

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run this script you'll need a PHP command line executable with `gettext
support`_ compiled in, and the basic `PEAR`_ libraries. The script expects your
PHP executable to be at ``/usr/bin/php``. If your executable is at another
place, either edit the first line of ``translation.php`` to reflect your
location or call the script like::

  /usr/local/bin/php translation.php.

You'll need the `gettext`_ package version 0.12 or greater.

You'll need the PEAR packages `Console_Getopt`_ 0.11 or greater,
`Console_Table`_ and `File_Find`_. To install all needed packages, run::

  pear upgrade PEAR Console_Getopt
  pear install Console_Table File_Find

or download the newest package from the `PEAR`_ server and install them
manually in your PEAR directory.

Creating a new translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new translation you first have to extract all gettext messages
from the PHP sources. There are already template files with the ``.pot``
suffix in the ``po`` directories that you can use if you have troubles
extracting the messages, though these templates might be slightly
outdated. Run::

  ./translation.php extract

You now have to create a new PO file for your locale. A locale has the form
``ll_CC`` where ``ll`` is the two letter `ISO 639`_ code of the language and
``CC`` the two letter `ISO 3166`_ code of the country, e.g. ``de_DE``,
``en_US`` or ``pt_BR``.
``translation.php`` is able to guess the locale from the ``LANG`` environment
variable but it is safer to specify the locale with the ``-l`` parameter.
To create the PO file run::

  ./translation.php init -l ll_CC

Now you can start the translation by editing the created ``ll_CC.po``
files. It is important to set the correct charset for the locale in the
``Content-Type:`` header.
You should fill out the the complete header of the created ``ll_CC.po`` file,
e.g.::

  # Dutch translation for Horde.

  "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
  "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\n"
  "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8-bit\n"

To compile the translations to a binary format run::

  ./translation.php make -l ll_CC

After you created the new translation you have to add entries for this locale
in the configuration file horde/config/nls.php.

If you create a new translation for a certain module but there are already
translations for the same language for other modules, then you should use a
compendium. This will save you a lot of time and it will make translations
much more consistent.

.. _ISO 3166: http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/index.html

Compendiums
~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool utilizes a nice feature of gettext: compendium files. A compendium
is a special PO file containing a set of translations recurring in many
different packages. These compendiums will be used in the background without
much intervention required. But you have to create and edit a compendium
before you can use it.

To create a compendium of all existing translations for a certain locale run::

  ./translation.php compendium -l ll_CC

The ``compendium.po`` being created will contain all modules' translations of
this locale merged into a single file. You should take a closer look at this
file because you may find a lot of special marked lines where you translated
certain strings differently in the various modules. It's a good idea to fix
the modules' translations now so that all modules use the same translations for
the same strings. You can always recreate your compendium with the above
command.

If you're maintaining translations for different `branches`_ and assumed that
you have all modules of the ``HEAD`` branches in one directory and all of the
``FRAMEWORK_3`` branches in another, you probably want to share a compendium
between these directories.

To do this, you should first create a compendium in the ``FRAMEWORK_3``
branch, review it and fix all translations until you're happy with the
results. Then create a second compendium in the ``HEAD`` branch and include
your first one with the --add option.  Now fix the translations in this
branch. If you're ready you can remove the first compendium and for now on use
the compendium in the ``HEAD`` branch for both branches. To do so, use the
``-c`` or ``--compendium`` option to specify a path to your compendium.

Updating translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process of updating translations is a cycle where you extract new gettext
strings from the sources, translate those new strings or update the already
translated strings and compile them after.

To update the translation for a module, run::

  ./translation.php update -m modulename -l ll_CC

This extracts the new strings from the sources and tries to update them from
already existing translations in the compendium. You just have to translate
all untranslated strings in the ``ll_CC.po`` file in the ``po`` directory of
the module you updated.

If extracting new strings fails for some reason, you can use the provided
``.pot`` file to update your translation::

  ./translation.php merge -m modulename -l ll_CC

If your compendium is in a different directory than the ``translation.php``
script, you can specify the path to the compendium::

  ./translation.php update -m modulename -l ll_CC -c /path/to/compendium

Once this is done, you can compile the translation by calling::

  ./translation.php make -m modulename -l ll_CC

Extending existent translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To have your own string (e.g. that you added to config files) displayed in
several languages, you have to

  1. specify your texts as gettext arguments, in English,
  2. edit the translation files for the required national languages,
  3. compile those translation files.

Be sure to keep records of your extensions, as you will probably have to
repeat steps 2 and 3 after the next update.

E.g., you plan to offer two IMAP servers to select from in the Webmail login
screen:

  1. In ``horde/imp/config/servers.php``, you specify::

       $servers['Central'] = array(
          'name' => _("Central Mail Service"),
       ...
       $servers['CompSci'] = array(
          'name' => _("Mail Service of Computer Science Dpt.")
       ...

  2. In ``horde/imp/po/de_DE.po`` you add two entries::

       msgid "Central Mail Service"
       msgstr "Zentraler Mailserver"

       msgid "Mail Service of Computer Science Dpt."
       msgstr "Mailserver Informatik"

     Likewise, you amend the translation files for other languages, as needed.

  3. You compile the translations using the commands::

       ./po/translation.php make --module imp --no-compendium

Access Keys
===========

Access keys, also known as shortcut keys, allow easy access to important
functions, normally by hitting the Alt/Meta key in combination with another
key. This key is marked in most user interfaces by being underlined.

As the access key is part of the word representing the action being executed,
it is in the translators responsibility to select an access key when he
translates these words. The action is always a link in Horde. The access key
of a link is selected by prefixing it with an underscore.

The help link in the menu for example is always "_Help". This means that the
"H" of the link will be underlined and the help can be opened by hitting
Alt+H. In the PO file this string will appear as::

  #: templates/menu/menu.inc:53
  msgid "_Help"
  msgstr ""

A Spanish translator might want to translate this to::

  #: templates/menu/menu.inc:53
  msgid "_Help"
  msgstr "_Ayuda"

Translators of multibyte languages need to do this a bit differently as only
ASCII characters are allowed for access keys. A Traditional Chinese translator
might want to use::

  #: templates/menu/menu.inc:53
  msgid "_Help"
  msgstr "_H說明"

This renders to "說明(H)" in the interface and you can
access this link with "H" as the access key.


Right-to-Left Languages
=======================

Translations for languages that are written from right to left might cause
unexpected behavior if parenthesis or similar characters appear inside a
translated string. To fix this broken string rendering you have to insert
special Unicode codepoints into the translated string.

Before such a string in parenthesis, add the U+202D codepoint. If there is
more right-to-left text to come after the closing parenthesis, add the U+202E
codepoint after it. If using the PO mode of the Emacs editor you can add
codepoints with the "ucs-insert" command.


Help Texts
==========

Organization of the help files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The help texts are available in the ``horde/locale/``, and
``horde/APP/locale/``, directories, where APP is any Horde application. Every
available translation is kept in a file called ``help.xml``, in a subdirectory
named according to RFC 3066. Examples:

- Horde's original help texts are in the ``horde/locale/en_US/help.xml`` file.
- IMP's Brazilian help texts are in the ``horde/imp/locale/pt_BR/help.xml``
  file.

When, for any desired application and locale, there is no ``help.xml`` file
available, Horde's help system will use the application's
``locale/en_US/help.xml`` file, instead.

The help files must be encoded in the language's preferred character set.

There is no compilation step involved: Every modification to, or addition of,
a ``help.xml`` file takes immediate effect.

Syntax of the help files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each help file must consist of syntactically valid XML code.

There are no predefined entities beyond the XML standard entities:

- &lt;   (less than)
- &gt;   (greater than)
- &amp;  (ampersand)
- &apos; (ASCII apostrophe)
- &quot; (ASCII quotation mark)

Any character available in the language's preferred character set can be
entered as a numerical character reference (based on its Unicode scalar
value), such as ``&#160;`` for the No-Break Space character.

The general structure can be learned from the existing examples; of course,
the XML tags must be syntactically valid, and properly nested.

.. Note:: A PHP error message like ``Undefined index: url in
          /opt/test-webmail/horde/lib/Horde/Help.php`` means that you have
          mis-spelled, or omitted, an attribute (``url``, in this example).

The following tags are available:

+---------+--------+---------------+-------------------------------+
| XML-Tag | Parent | Attributes    | Purpose                       |

Reference from the Horde applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The typical incantation, e.g.::

  <?php echo Horde_Help::link('imp', 'compose-buttons') ?>

will yield a link, adorned with the ``help.png`` icon, to the entry marked
``id="compose-buttons"`` in the IMP help file pertaining to the user's current
locale. Usually, these links are placed in the template files, next to the
item to be explained by the pertinent help entry.

The Horde menu will usually contain a general help item, which is generated in
``lib/Horde/Menu.php``.

Creating a new translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If necessary, define a suitable locale id ``ll_CC``, complying with RFC
3066. E.g., if you plan to add an Austrian translation, you would use
``de_AT`` as your locale id.

For Horde, and for all relevant applications, copy the ``help.xml`` files from
the ``locale/en_US/`` subdirectories to the ``locale/ll_CC/`` subdirectories,
creating them if necessary.

Translate each new ``locale/ll_CC/help.xml`` file, leaving all tags and
attributes unchanged. Just translate the text between the tags.

.. Important:: The ``id`` attributes must be kept unchanged, under any
               circumstances.

If the application is already translated and only the help files are missing,
then be sure to use the same terminology as the existing translation. In any
case, try to use a lucid, coherent terminology.

Finishing a translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to submit a translation to be included in the Horde code base,
make sure that you have completed all translations. Then run::

  ./translation.php make-help

This will mark all entries as being up-to-date so that you or other
translators can later see which entries have been changed since then.

Updating an existing translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run::

  ./translation.php update-help

This will merge your existing help file with all changes from the original,
English help file since your last translation. Changed entries are marked with
the attribute ``state="changed"``, new entries with ``state="new"``. The
original entry from the English help file is added in a comment below a
changed entry, so that you can easily compare them.

Translate the remaining English phrases, like discussed above. When your
finished, remove any English entries and follow the steps at `Finishing a
translation`_.

Extending existent translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you feel that some feature should be better explained to the end user, then
proceed as following:

1. Determine, whether you will have to extend an existing entry, or add a new
   one.

2. In the latter case, choose a suitable ``id`` for your new help entry.

3. Edit the existing entry in, or add a new entry to, the application's
   ``en_US/help.xml`` file. Change all translations needed in your site in the
   same way. Be sure to use the same ``id`` everywhere.

4. If you have added a new entry, you might want to add a link to it from a
   template, as explained above in `Reference from the Horde applications`_.

5. If you feel that your enhancement may be useful to other users, file an
   enhancement request at http://bugs.horde.org/ with a patch including your
   changes to the template and the ``help.xml`` files.

6. In any case, keep notes of your changes, so you can apply them to later
   versions if necessary.
