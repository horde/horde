      interface (Request #1578)

      other apps using Horde authentication.
[cjh] Working addObject() and removeObject() SQL driver methods.
[cjh] Move Turba_Source::getMyObject() to Turba_Source::getObject(); nothing
      was using the old getObject() call anymore.
[cjh] If you set $params['bind_dn'] and $params['bind_password'] for an LDAP

      Turba_List, where it really belongs.
[cjh] We now actually use Turba_List, Turba_AbstractObject, Turba_ListView,
      and many other pieces of the class hierarchy that were previously only
      referenced in the object model.
[cjh] Clean up the sql Driver implementation a bit. Now, if the source is
      private, the __owner criteria must match the current user, instead of
      using __key. __key should uniquely identify each object, and shouldn't
      be what user that object belongs to.
[cjh] Reorganize the class hierarchy a bit - use Object instead of Contact,
      and a few other naming changes.
[cjh] Merged WAP functionality into search.php. If a WAP browser is
      detected, a slimmed-down wml interface will be used that only displays
      names and (callable) phone numbers.
