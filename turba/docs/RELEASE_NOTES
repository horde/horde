The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Turba
Contact Manager version H5 (4.1.0).

Turba is the Horde contact management application. Leveraging the Horde
framework to provide seamless integration with IMP and other Horde
applications, it supports storing contacts in SQL, LDAP, Kolab, and IMSP
address books. For more information on Turba, visit
http://www.horde.org/apps/turba.

Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The major changes compared to the Turba H5 (4.0) versions are:
    * Added CardDAV server support.
    * Allow to search all search fields at once.
    * Small improvements.
