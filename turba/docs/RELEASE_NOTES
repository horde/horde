The Horde Team is pleased to announce the last beta release of the Turba
Contact Manager version H5 (4.0.0).

Turba is the Horde contact management application. Leveraging the Horde
framework to provide seamless integration with IMP and other Horde
applications, it supports storing contacts in SQL, LDAP, Kolab, and IMSP
address books. For more information on Turba, visit
http://www.horde.org/apps/turba.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is feature complete but there are likely to be bugs. You
should not use this preview version with existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

The major changes compared to the Turba version H5 (4.0.0beta2) are:
    * Added initial implementation of a smartphone view.
    * Completed interface redesign.
    * Improved support for email fields with multiple addresses.
    * Improved Kolab support.
    * Dropped preference which address books to display.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
