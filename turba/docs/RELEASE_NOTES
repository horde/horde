The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Turba
Contact Manager version H5 (4.2.0).

Turba is the Horde contact management application. Leveraging the Horde
framework to provide seamless integration with IMP and other Horde
applications, it supports contacts in SQL, LDAP, Kolab, IMSP, and Facebook
address books, and works as a CardDAV server. For more information on Turba,
visit http://www.horde.org/apps/turba.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.
