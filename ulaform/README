Ulaform is a PHP-based dynamic HTML form creation and generation
system. Ulaform allows users to create sophisticated forms using a web browser,
and then render the forms within other web pages by a simple PHP include inside
a <?php ... ?> tag, or in other Horde applications through the Horde Block api.
Ulaform is intended to replace other dynamic form generation techniques (such
as FrontPage forms which require the FrontPage extensions on the server, or CGI
scripts which require some programming ability).

Ulaform is based on the Horde_Form library of the Horde framework. This gives
it some useful capabilities: the ability to automatically validate data, using
JavaScript if available (or re-rendering of the form if not); the ability to
use GET or POST transparently; and others.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.
