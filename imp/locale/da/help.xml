"Skjult kopi" meddelelser er som regel sendt til personer andre end de direkte og indirekte modtagere (Til: og Cc:) som har behov for at læse meddelelsen UDEN at de andre modtagere ved at de får meddelelsen. Dvs. 'Skjult' betyder at identiteten af disse modtagere er skjult fra alle andre modtagere af meddelelsen, og at kun du og de ved at de modtog en kopi.

Blind carbon copies are usually sent to people other than direct and indirect recipients (&quot;To:&quot; and &quot;Cc:&quot; recipients) who need to read what is being written as well WITHOUT the other recipients knowing that they are receiving the email. Thus 'blind' means that the identity of these recipients is hidden from all other recipients of the email, and only you and they know they got a copy.

The subject line is the easiest way for you and your correspondents to remember what was in the email and thus is very important in organizing your email and finding important ones later.  Also, when you 'Reply' or 'Forward' and email this subject line is copied over into the new message and so is a valuable way of telling what messages go together to form a &quot;thread&quot; of a conversation.  However, if the 'Reply' or 'Forward' contains new ideas, you may want to add simple modifications to the 'Subject' line so the recipient(s) can follow the progression of the &quot;thread.&quot;

    <para>
    S/MIME is a private/public key pair system which provides digital signatures, message privacy, and tamper detection in a open, interoperable way.  S/MIME can provide message privacy by encrypting messages that only the sender and the intended recipients can decode.  It allows you to identify the sender of a message via a digital signature.  Together, this encryption and digital signing help provide tamper detection, allowing recipients to determine whether a message was altered after it was sent.
