    輸入郵件的主旨。
    你所輸入的主旨將成為送出郵件的"主旨:"。
    盡可能以簡單扼要的描述來說明主旨。
    主旨是最容易讓人能夠在日後回想起這封郵件內容的方法，
    因此在編寫郵件時主旨是相當重要的。
    而且，當你'回覆'或'轉寄'郵件時主旨也將會一併放進新郵件中，
    如此一來郵件之間才能型成一種關聯。
    然而，如果你對'回覆'或'轉寄'的郵件內容中做了些許的改變，
    或許你可以考慮在'主旨'上增加簡單的變動通知，
    如此所有的收信對象才能繼續依循此一"關聯"。

    <heading>Validate PGP Public Keys When Replying</heading>
    <para>
    If set, and PGP encryption is used by default for composing messages, IMP will verify that it can access all recipients' public keys when the reply is first created. This has the disadvantage that it may cause a delay in opening the reply window. However, it has the advantage of informing you immediately if you will be able to correctly send the encrypted message to all recipients immediately.

    這個選項將使用收件對象的 PGP 個人公開金鑰，為目前編寫的郵件加密。
    使用這個選項編寫郵件時，收件對象僅只能有一位。
    在你的通訊錄中必須存有這位收件對象的 PGP 公開金鑰，否則將會出現錯誤的狀況。
    如果你的通訊錄中確實已存在這位收件對象的 PGP 公開金鑰，
    但仍然收到錯誤的訊息時，請檢查一下收件對象的電子郵件住址是否與通訊錄中
    該筆 PGP 公開金鑰的電子郵件住址相吻合。
    加密資料將附加於郵件中一併寄出。

        <para>
            Your public key should be made available to any person that you want to be able to send you encrypted messages that only YOU can decrypt (using your private key). Additionally, your public key needs to be made available to anybody you send a digitally signed message to - a public key is required to verify the digital signature.
        </para>
        <heading>Your Private Key</heading>
        <para>
            Your private key is necessary to decrypt any message encrypted using your public key. Additionally, your private key is needed if you want to digitally sign a message. Your private key will be protected via a passphrase created when the keys are generated. Thus, to perform any activity that requires your private key, you will be prompted for your passphrase. Entry of your passphrase is only needed once per session.

    <para>
    PGP 是一種用於通訊以及資料的加密工具，特別是用於電子郵件。 
    PGP 可用於資料的加密、建立數位簽章。 網路郵局使用 GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard)
    以提供上述的服務。
    S/MIME 是另一種私密/公開金鑰對系統。該系統提供諸如：數位簽章，郵件加密，以及
    在開放共用上提供竄改偵測的技術。 S/MIME 可以提供郵件加密的功能，加密後的郵
    件只有寄送者及收件者可以解密。S/MIME 還可以經由數位簽章來辨識寄送者的郵件。
    加密與數位簽章一起使用更可以提供竄改偵測的功能，好讓所有收件對象判定郵件在
    寄發後是否曾被竄改。

    S/MIME is a private/public key pair system which provides digital signatures, message privacy, and tamper detection in a open, interoperable way. S/MIME can provide message privacy by encrypting messages that only the sender and the intended recipients can decode. It allows you to identify the sender of a message via a digital signature. Together, this encryption and digital signing help provide tamper detection, allowing recipients to determine whether a message was altered after it was sent.

        <heading>What is S/MIME?</heading>
        <para>
            S/MIME is a private/public key pair system which provides digital signatures, message privacy, and tamper detection in an open, interoperable way. S/MIME can provide message privacy by encrypting messages that only the sender and the intended recipients can decode. It allows you to identify the sender of a message via a digital signature. Together, this encryption and digital signing help provide tamper detection, allowing recipients to determine whether a message was altered after it was sent.
        </para>
        <heading>Enable S/MIME functionality?</heading>
        <para>
            If this option is selected, you will be able to import your personal S/MIME keys, read encrypted mail, verify digitally signed mail, and encrypt/sign your outgoing mail.
