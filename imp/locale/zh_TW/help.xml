            Carbon copies are usually sent to recipients who need not be the direct recipients of the message, but may need to receive the message for their information, usually indirectly concerned about the subject of the e-mail. All "To:" recipients and "Cc:" recipients can see the entire list of both kinds of recipients.

    輸入郵件的主旨。
    你所輸入的主旨將成為送出郵件的"主旨:"。
    盡可能以簡單扼要的描述來說明主旨。
    主旨是最容易讓人能夠在日後回想起這封郵件內容的方法，
    因此在編寫郵件時主旨是相當重要的。
    而且，當你'回覆'或'轉寄'郵件時主旨也將會一併放進新郵件中，
    如此一來郵件之間才能型成一種關聯。
    然而，如果你對'回覆'或'轉寄'的郵件內容中做了些許的改變，
    或許你可以考慮在'主旨'上增加簡單的變動通知，
    如此所有的收信對象才能繼續依循此一"關聯"。

    <para>
    If set, and PGP encryption is used by default for composing messages, IMP will verify that it can access all recipients' public keys when the reply is first created. This has the disadvantage that it may cause a delay in opening the reply window. However, it has the advantage of informing you immediately if you will be able to correctly send the encrypted message to all recipients immediately.

    <para>
    PGP 是一種用於通訊以及資料的加密工具，特別是用於電子郵件。 
    PGP 可用於資料的加密、建立數位簽章。 網路郵局使用 GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard)
    以提供上述的服務。
    S/MIME 是另一種私密/公開金鑰對系統。該系統提供諸如：數位簽章，郵件加密，以及
    在開放共用上提供竄改偵測的技術。 S/MIME 可以提供郵件加密的功能，加密後的郵
    件只有寄送者及收件者可以解密。S/MIME 還可以經由數位簽章來辨識寄送者的郵件。
    加密與數位簽章一起使用更可以提供竄改偵測的功能，好讓所有收件對象判定郵件在
    寄發後是否曾被竄改。

    S/MIME is a private/public key pair system which provides digital signatures, message privacy, and tamper detection in a open, interoperable way. S/MIME can provide message privacy by encrypting messages that only the sender and the intended recipients can decode. It allows you to identify the sender of a message via a digital signature. Together, this encryption and digital signing help provide tamper detection, allowing recipients to determine whether a message was altered after it was sent.
