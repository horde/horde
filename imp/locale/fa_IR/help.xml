  <title>Forwarding Email</title>
  <para>When forwarding an email, you have several choices.</para>

  <heading>Forwarding from the Mailbox View</heading>
  <para>In the mailbox view, you can forward multiple messages at the same time. Each message that you select will be sent, in its entirety, to your recipients. You will see each message as an attachment in your compose window. On the receiving end, the recipient(s) will see each email as an embedded email.</para>

  <heading>Forwarding from the Message View</heading>
  <para>When forwarding individual messages in the message view, you can choose three different options:</para>
  <para><b>1. Entire Message</b>: This option will attach the entire message to your email. The compose area will not contain any text from the forwarded message. This is the same as forwading a single email from the mailbox view, except that the Subject: line will be set for you.</para>
  <para><b>2. Body Text Only</b>: If you only want to forward the body of the email, choose this option. Any attachments to the original email will not be included in your forward. The text will appear in the compose area, and you can edit it if you wish or add your own comments.</para>
  <para><b>3. Body Text with Attachments</b>: To forward the attachments of an email along, along with the body as described in #2 Body Text Only, use this option. The body text will be placed in the compose area for you to edit, and all attachments to the original message will be copied to your forward.</para>

    <title>Message Composition: Link Attachments</title>
    <para>
    Determines whether the attachments in your composition are sent as a part of the mail message or whether those attachments are kept on a local server.  If attachments are linked, the recipient(s) of your message will be provided a weblink where they can download the attachment(s).  Linking attachments has the advantage of tremendously reducing the size of outgoing messages.  Linking attachments has the disadvantage that the content of the attachments can not be guaranteed to be available in the future since the attachment data is not located within the e-mail message.

    <title>Preferences: Default Message Character Set</title>
    <para>
    Define the default character set to use for text message parts that do not contain explicit character set information. Per RFC 2045, messages without a character set parameter are displayed using the 'US-ASCII' character set. However, certain badly broken mailers may send out text messages in other character sets without setting the proper parameters in the message header. Set this parameter to the default character set string to use locally. Select "Default" to use the MIME defaults.

    <title>Preferences: Delete Spam After Reporting</title>
    <para>
    You may elect to do one of three items after reporting a message as either spam or innocent.
    </para>
    <para>
    First, you can decide to do nothing - the message will be reported as either spam or innocent but will otherwise remain unchanged in your mailbox.
    </para>
    <para>
    Second, if reporting a message as spam, you can instead have the message be immediately deleted.  This setting has no effect on reporting a message as innocent.
    </para>
    <para>
    Third, after reporting a message as spam the message will be deleted from the current mailbox and moved to your spam folder.  Alternatively, if reporting a message as innocent the message will be deleted from the current mailbox and moved to your INBOX.
    </para>

    <title>Virtual Folders: Virtual Trash</title>
    <para>
    Virtual Trash is a saved search that does away with the need for a separate Trash folder.  Instead of moving messages to a centralized trash folder, messages are simply marked as deleted in the current folder they live in.  When 'show deleted messages' is turned off, this results in these messages not appearing in a mailbox view.  When a user clicks on Virtual Trash, *all* mailboxes all searched for messages that are flagged deleted and these messages are displayed in a single mailbox.
