            Carbon copies are usually sent to recipients who need not be the direct recipients of the message, but may need to receive the message for their information, usually indirectly concerned about the subject of the e-mail.

            Blind carbon copies are usually sent to recipients who may need to read what is being written WITHOUT the other recipients knowing that they are receiving the e-mail. Thus &quot;blind&quot; means that the identity of these recipients is hidden from all other recipients of the e-mail. Only you (as the sender) and the &quot;Bcc&quot; recipients will know that they received a copy.

        <para>
            Enter the subject of your message. It is best to keep the subject short, simple and descriptive. The subject line is the easiest way for you and your correspondents to remember what was in the e-mail, and is generally used as the basis for quickly scanning e-mails in a mailbox.
        </para>
        <para>
            When you &quot;Reply&quot; or &quot;Forward&quot; an e-mail, this subject line is copied over into the new message so that is becomes a valuable way of identifying which messages go together to form a &quot;thread&quot; to an e-mail conversation.
        </para>
        <tip>
            If a replied or forwarded message contains new ideas, you may want to alter the &quot;Subject&quot; line so that recipients can follow the progression of the &quot;thread&quot; and to indicate that the content of the thread has deviated from the initial topic.

            You may not want to save every e-mail since you could have problems with your disk storage quota being used up quickly, especially when you send large attachments. A mailbox with full storage quota will not be able to receive new incoming e-mail.

        <para>
            S/MIME is a private/public key pair system which provides digital signatures, message privacy, and tamper detection in a open, interoperable way. S/MIME can provide message privacy by encrypting messages that only the sender and the intended recipients can decode. It allows you to identify the sender of a message via a digital signature. Together, this encryption and digital signing help provide tamper detection, allowing recipients to determine whether a message was altered after it was sent.
