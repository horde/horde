This document contains instructions for installing the IMP web-based mail
client on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of IMP, see the file
`docs/README`_.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, IMP **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   IMP runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for web applications written in PHP. You must install Horde before
   installing IMP.

   .. Important:: IMP 6 requires version 5.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will not work.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing IMP. Many of IMP's prerequisites are also Horde
                  prerequisites. Additionally, many of IMP's optional features
                  are configured via the Horde install.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/apps/horde

2. The following PHP capabilities:

   a. File Upload Support

      File upload support is **required** to allow attachments in mail
      composition and to allow various importing features to work (e.g.
      importing PGP or S/MIME keys, importing mbox files).  See
      `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on how to enable file upload
      support.

   b. OpenSSL support ``--with-openssl``

      The OpenSSL PHP extension is used by IMP to provide S/MIME support.
      Without the extension, all S/MIME options will be disabled.

      Additionally, the OpenSSL PHP extension is REQUIRED if using TLS or SSL
      to connect to the IMAP/POP3 server.

      See http://www.php.net/openssl for information on compiling OpenSSL
      into PHP.

3. At least one IMAP or POP3 server.

   While IMP is an application that is installed on a web server and is run
   from a web browser, it is only an IMAP and POP3 *client*, like Outlook,
   Apple Mail, or Thunderbird. You must have access to an IMAP or POP3
   server(s) on which your users' mail is stored in order to use IMP.

   IMAP is **strongly** recommended over POP3.  See, e.g.,
   http://staff.washington.edu/gray/papers/imap.vs.pop.brief.html

   Freely available IMAP servers (for \*nix systems) that have been verified
   to work best with IMP include:

   - Archiveopteryx (http://www.archiveopteryx.org/)
   - Courier-IMAP (http://www.inter7.com/courierimap.html)
   - Cyrus (http://www.cyrusimap.org/)
   - Dovecot (http://www.dovecot.org/)
   - UW-IMAP (ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/)

   Most of these packages also include POP3 support as well.

   The Horde Project recommends either Cyrus or Dovecot (see
   `docs/PERFORMANCE`_ for further information).

   The IMAP server MUST support IMAP4rev1 (RFC 3501).
   The POP server MUST support POP3 (RFC 1939/STD 53).

   .. Note:: If using a POP server, it MUST support the UIDL capability.
             POP3 support is limited to performing only basic mail actions;
             Caching, on-demand filtering, searching, and sorting will be
             disabled.

4. Sendmail or SMTP server.

   Horde/IMP sends mail via either a local sendmail or a remote SMTP server.
   It is **RECOMMENDED** that SMTP be used.

   See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for further information.

The following items are not required, but are strongly **RECOMMENDED**:

1. Turba, the Horde contacts manager.

   Turba is the Horde contact management application, designed to be
   integrated with other Horde applications to provide a unified interface to
   contact management throughout the Horde suite.

   Turba is available from:

      http://www.horde.org/apps/turba

   Turba provides the local address book and an LDAP directory search function
   to IMP.

   You must use the 3.x branch of Turba with IMP 6.

2. Ingo, the Horde mail filters manager.

   Ingo is the Horde mail filters management application, designed to be
   integrated with other Horde applications to provide a unified interface to
   mail filter management throughout the Horde suite.

   Ingo is available from:

      http://www.horde.org/apps/ingo

   Ingo provides the mail filtering interfaces to IMP.

   You must use the 2.x branch of Ingo with IMP 6.

3. A web server with PATH_INFO support.

   IMP requires the PATH_INFO environment variable for several features. Every
   modern web server supports this, but you might have to enable this feature
   in the web server configuration. e.g. Apache servers require::

      AcceptPathInfo On

   Lighttpd servers require::

     "broken-scriptfilename" => "enable"

4. A configured VFS backend.

   During composition of messages, it is possible that the PHP session may
   timeout. If VFS is enabled in Horde, IMP can store the draft message and
   allow the user to recover the message when they next login.

The following items are not required, but if present will enable advanced
features in IMP:

1. Nag, the Horde tasks manager.

   Nag is the Horde tasks management application, designed to be integrated
   with other Horde applications to provide a unified interface to task
   management throughout the Horde suite.

   Nag is available from:

      http://www.horde.org/apps/nag

   Nag allows a user to create new tasks from individual email messages.

   You must use the 3.x branch of Nag with IMP 5.x.


Installing IMP
==============

The **RECOMMENDED** way to install IMP is using the PEAR installer.
Alternatively, if you want to run the latest development code or get the
latest not yet released fixes, you can install IMP from Git.

Installing with PEAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First follow the instructions in `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ to prepare a PEAR
environment for Horde and install the Horde Framework.

When installing IMP through PEAR now, the installer will automatically install
any dependencies of IMP too. If you want to install IMP with all optional
dependencies, but without the binary PECL packages that need to be compiled,
specify both the ``-a`` and the ``-B`` flag::

   pear install -a -B horde/imp-beta

By default, only the required dependencies will be installed::

   pear install horde/imp-beta

If you want to install IMP even with all binary dependencies, you need to
remove the ``-B`` flag. Please note that this might also try to install PHP
extensions through PECL that might need further configuration or activation in
your PHP configuration::

   pear install -a horde/imp-beta

Installing from Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See http://www.horde.org/source/git.php


Configuring IMP
===============

1. Configuring Horde for IMP [OPTIONAL]

   If you would prefer that your users authenticate directly with IMP, without
   having to authenticate through Horde first, load the
   ``Administration/Configuration/Authentication`` page and from the ``What
   backend should we use for authenticating users to Horde`` pulldown menu
   select ``Let a Horde application handle authentication`` (see the note
   below about new installs).  Select ``imp`` from the ``The application which
   is providing authentication`` pulldown menu.

   .. Note:: **You will have to log in twice if you don't do this** -- Once to
             Horde and a second time to IMP.

   .. Note:: If this is a new install, you will not be able to configure IMP
             using the Horde Administration/Configuration page if you first
             enabled IMP authentication for Horde.  You must set Horde to use
             another authentication method (refer to the `horde/docs/INSTALL`_
             file), configure IMP, then reset Horde to use IMP authentication.
             One way to reset Horde in order to reach the Administration page
             is to replace the Horde configuration file ``conf.php`` with the
             original in ``horde/config/conf.php.dist``.  You should of course
             back up your current settings since they will otherwise be
             permanently lost.

2. Configuring IMP

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the configuration
   of IMP.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get to the
   administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to get the
   configuration page.  Select ``Mail`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Mail Configuration`` to generate the ``conf.php``
   file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to the IMP
   configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the file.  In
   this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the other methods
   to create the configuration file ``imp/config/conf.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the other configuration files in
   the ``config/`` directory can be found in each file. You may create
   ``*.local.php`` versions of these files if you wish to customize IMP's
   appearance and behavior. See the header of the configuration files for
   details and examples. The defaults will be correct for most sites.

   IMP Configuration Pointers

   * By default, IMP is configured to NOT display text/html message parts
     inline.  This is done for various security reasons.  If you would like to
     see text/html parts inline, you must create a
     ``imp/config/mime_drivers.local.php`` file with the following content::

        <?php
        $mime_drivers['html']['inline'] = true;

3. Creating the database tables

   Once you finished the configuration in the previous step, you can create all
   database tables by clicking the ``DB schema is out of date`` link in the
   IMP row of the configuration screen.

   Alternatively, creating the IMP database tables can be accomplished with
   horde's ``horde-db-migrate`` utility. If your database is properly setup in
   the Horde configuration, you can run the following command::

      horde/bin/horde-db-migrate imp

4. Securing IMP

   Before you can secure IMP, you need a secure Horde installation.  Please
   read the file in `horde/docs/SECURITY`_ for Horde security information
   before proceeding.

   There are two channels by which, unless steps are taken to avoid it, IMP
   encourages users to pass their IMAP and POP3 passwords around the Internet
   unencrypted.

   The first channel is between their browser and the Web server.  We strongly
   recommend using an SSL-capable Web server to give users the option of
   encrypting communications between their browser and the Web server on which
   IMP is running; some sites may wish to disable non-SSL access entirely.

   The second channel is between the Web server and their IMAP or POP3 server.
   The simplest way to avoid this is to have the mail server running on the
   same system as the Web server, and configuring IMP to connect to the IMAP
   or POP3 server on ``localhost`` instead of on the Internet hostname.  In
   cases where that is not possible, it is highly recommended that the mail
   server be located on a private, secure network. Alternatively, the mail
   server can be accessed via TLS (or via the deprecated SSL-specific ports)
   to ensure that users' passwords remain safe after they have entrusted them
   to IMP.

   Other security steps you can take to increase security include:

   * Use session cookies instead of URL based sessions.
   * Set your php ``session.entropy_length`` to a larger value (e.g. 16) and
     ``session.entropy_file`` to a random source (e.g. ``/dev/urandom``)
   * Enable and use the php mycrypt extension.
   * If your database, mail server, and web server are on the same host
     machine, then:

     * Use unix socket database access and disable tcp database access.
     * Use ``localhost`` for all TCP/IP connections to avoid the network.
     * Use the command-line sendmail for sending mail if possible.

5. Testing IMP

   Once you have configured IMP, bring up the Horde test page in your Web
   browser to ensure that all necessary prerequisites have been met.  See the
   `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ document for further details on the Horde test
   script.

   The test script will also allow you to test your connection to the mail
   server and provide some auto-detected configuration parameters that can
   then be inserted into the server configuration located in
   ``imp/config/backends.local.php``.

   Next, use IMP to login to a known working IMAP or POP3 server.  Test at
   least the following:

   - Sending mail (via the ``Compose`` item in the menu bar).
   - Setting preferences (check to see if they survive after logging out and
     back in, if you are using an SQL or LDAP preferences system).
   - Reading mail.
   - Deleting mail.
   - Flagging mail (if using IMAP).
   - Changing mailboxes (if using IMAP).
