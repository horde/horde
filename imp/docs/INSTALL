This document contains instructions for installing the IMP web-based mail
client on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of IMP, see the file README_
in the top-level directory of the IMP distribution.


Obtaining IMP
=============

IMP can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/imp/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/imp/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of IMP are available via Git; see the file
`horde/docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution, or the website
http://www.horde.org/source/, for information on accessing the Horde Git
repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, IMP **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   IMP runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   before installing IMP.

   .. Important:: IMP 5.0 requires version 4.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing IMP. Many of IMP's prerequisites are also Horde
                  prerequisites. Additionally, many of IMP's optional features
                  are configured via the Horde install.

2. The following PHP capabilities:

   a. File Upload Support

      File upload support is **required** to allow attachments in mail
      composition and to allow various importing features to work (e.g.
      importing PGP or S/MIME keys, importing mbox files).  See
      `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on how to enable file upload
      support.

3. The following PEAR modules:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PEAR modules)

   a. Auth_SASL [OPTIONAL]

      Auth_SASL is required only if your IMAP server uses CRAM-MD5 or
      DIGEST-MD5 authentication.

4. At least one IMAP or POP3 server.

   While IMP is an application that is installed on a Web server and is run
   from a Web browser, it is only an IMAP and POP3 *client*, like Outlook,
   Apple Mail, or Thunderbird. You must have access to an IMAP or POP3
   server(s) on which your users' mail is stored in order to use IMP.

   IMAP is *strongly* recommended over POP3.  See, e.g.,
   http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.brief.html

   Freely available IMAP servers (for \*nix systems) that have been verified
   to work with IMP include:

   - Archiveopteryx (http://www.archiveopteryx.org/)
   - Courier-IMAP (http://www.inter7.com/courierimap.html)
   - Cyrus (http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/)
   - Dovecot (http://www.dovecot.org/)
   - UW-IMAP (ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/)

   Most of these pacakages also include POP3 support as well.

   The selected IMAP server MUST support IMAP4rev1 (RFC 3501).
   The selected POP server MUST support POP3 (RFC 1939/STD 53).

   .. If using a POP server, caching, on-demand filtering, searching, and
      sorting are disabled.
      POP3 support is limited essentially to only viewing messages.
      An IMAP server is REQUIRED for all other advanced features.

5. Sendmail or SMTP server.

   Horde sends mail via either a local sendmail or a remote SMTP server.

   See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for further information.

The following items are not required, but are strongly **RECOMMENDED**:

1. Turba, the Horde contacts manager.

   Turba is the Horde contact management application, designed to be
   integrated with other Horde applications to provide a unified interface to
   contact management throughout the Horde suite.

   Turba is available from:

      http://www.horde.org/turba/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/turba/

   Turba provides the local address book and an LDAP directory search function
   to IMP.

   You must use the 3.x branch of Turba with IMP 5.x.

2. Ingo, the Horde mail filters manager.

   Ingo is the Horde mail filters management application, designed to be
   integrated with other Horde applications to provide a unified interface to
   mail filter management throughout the Horde suite.

   Ingo is available from:

      http://www.horde.org/ingo/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/ingo/

   Ingo provides the mail filtering interfaces to IMP.

   You must use the 2.x branch of Ingo with IMP 5.x.

3. Nag, the Horde tasks manager.

   Nag is the Horde tasks management application, designed to be integrated
   with other Horde applications to provide a unified interface to task
   management throughout the Horde suite.

   Nag is available from:

      http://www.horde.org/nag/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/nag/

   If Nag is available on your system, users can easily create new tasks from
   individual email messages.

   You must use the 3.x branch of Nag with IMP 5.x.

4. Gollem, the Horde file manager.

   Gollem is the Horde file management application, designed to be
   integrated with other Horde applications to provide a unified interface to
   access VFS filesystems throughout the Horde suite.

   Gollem is available from:

      http://www.horde.org/gollem/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/gollem/

   Gollem allows a user to attach files from various VFS filesystems to
   outgoing messages in IMP.

   You must use the 2.x branch of Gollem with IMP 5.x.

5. A web server with PATH_INFO support.

   IMP requires the PATH_INFO environment variable for several features. Every
   modern web server supports this, but you might have to enable this feature
   in the web server configuration. e.g. Apache servers require::

      AcceptPathInfo On

   If the webserver does not provide PATH_INFO information, IMP attempts to
   create the information using other server variables, but this process is
   slower and less reliable.

6. A configured VFS backend.

   During composition of messages, it is possible that the PHP session may
   timeout. If VFS is enabled in Horde, IMP can store the draft message and
   allow the user to recover the message when they next login.


Installing IMP
==============

IMP is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, IMP is installed directly underneath Horde in the web server's
document tree.

Since IMP is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply expand
the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root directory of
the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For example, with
the Apache web server's default document root of ``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``,
you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/imp-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv imp-x.y.z imp

and would then find IMP at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/imp/


Configuring IMP
===============

1. Configuring Horde for IMP

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the 'imp' stanza.  The default
      settings here should be okay, but you can change them if desired.  If you
      have changed the location of IMP relative to Horde, either in the URL, in
      the filesystem or both, you must update the ``fileroot`` and ``webroot``
      settings to their correct values.

   b. Enable IMP authentication [OPTIONAL]

      If you would prefer that your users authenticate directly with IMP,
      without having to authenticate through Horde first, load the
      ``Administration/Configuration/Authentication`` page and from the ``What
      backend should we use for authenticating users to Horde`` pulldown menu
      select ``Let a Horde application handle authentication``.  (Please see
      the second note below.) Select ``imp`` from the ``The application which
      is providing authentication`` pulldown menu.

      .. Note:: **You will have to log in twice if you don't do this** -- Once
                to Horde and a second time to IMP.

      .. Note:: If this is a new install, you will not be able to configure IMP
                using the Horde Administration/Configuration page if you first
                enabled IMP authentication for Horde.  You must set Horde to
                use another authentication method (refer to the
                `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file), configure IMP, then reset Horde to
                use IMP authentication.  One way to reset Horde in order to
                reach the Administration page is to replace the Horde
                configuration file ``conf.php`` with the original in
                ``horde/config/conf.php.dist``.  You should of course back up
                your current settings since they will otherwise be permanently
                lost.

2. Creating the database table

   Creating the IMP database table(s) can be accomplished with horde's
   ``db_migrate`` utility.  If your database is properly setup in the Horde
   configuration, just run the following::

      horde/bin/db_migrate imp

3. Configuring IMP

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the configuration files in the
   ``config/`` directory can be found in each file.  You may edit these files
   if you wish to customize IMP's appearance and behavior.  The defaults will
   be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the configuration
   of IMP.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get to the
   administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to get the
   configuration page.  Select ``Mail`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Mail Configuration`` to generate the ``conf.php``
   file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to the IMP
   configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the file.  In
   this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the other methods
   to create the configuration file ``imp/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: IMP uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

   IMP Configuration Pointers

   * By default, IMP is configured to NOT display text/html message parts
     inline.  This is done for various security reasons.  If you would like to
     see text/html parts inline, you must create a
     ``imp/config/mime_drivers.local.php`` file with the following content::

        <?php
        $mime_drivers['html']['inline'] = true;

4. Securing IMP

   Before you can secure IMP, you need a secure Horde installation.  Please
   read the file in `horde/docs/SECURITY`_ for Horde security information
   before proceeding.

   There are two channels by which, unless steps are taken to avoid it, IMP
   encourages users to pass their IMAP and POP3 passwords around the Internet
   unencrypted.

   The first channel is between their browser and the Web server.  We strongly
   recommend using an SSL-capable Web server to give users the option of
   encrypting communications between their browser and the Web server on which
   IMP is running; some sites may wish to disable non-SSL access entirely.

   The second channel is between the Web server and their IMAP or POP3 server.
   The simplest way to avoid this is to have the mail server running on the
   same system as the Web server, and configuring IMP to connect to the IMAP
   or POP3 server on ``localhost`` instead of on the Internet hostname.  In
   cases where that is not possible, it is highly recommended that the mail
   server be located on a private, secure network. Alternatively, the mail
   server can be accessed via TLS (or via the deprecated SSL-specific ports)
   to ensure that users' passwords remain safe after they have entrusted them
   to IMP.

   Other security steps you can take to increase security include:

   * Use session cookies instead of URL based sessions.
   * Set your php ``session.entropy_length`` to a larger value (e.g. 16) and
     ``session.entropy_file`` to a random source (e.g. ``/dev/urandom``)
   * Enable and use the php mycrypt extension.
   * If your database, mail server, and web server are on the same host
     machine, then:

     * Use unix socket database access and disable tcp database access.
     * Use ``localhost`` for all TCP/IP connections to avoid the network.
     * Use the command-line sendmail for sending mail if possible.

5. Testing IMP

   Once you have configured IMP, bring up the Horde test page in your Web
   browser to ensure that all necessary prerequisites have been met.  See the
   `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ document for further details on the Horde test
   script.

   The test script will also allow you to test your connection to the mail
   server and provide some auto-detected configuration parameters that can
   then be inserted into the server configuration located in
   ``imp/config/backends.php``.

   Next, use IMP to login to a known working IMAP or POP3 server.  Test at
   least the following:

   - Sending mail (via the ``Compose`` item in the menu bar).
   - Setting preferences (check to see if they survive after logging out and
     back in, if you are using an SQL or LDAP preferences system).
   - Reading mail.
   - Deleting mail.
   - Flagging mail (if using IMAP).
   - Changing folders (if using IMAP).

6. Tuning IMP (Performance)

   See `horde/docs/PERFORMANCE`_.

   IMP Specific Performance Information::

   IMP can use persistent caching on the server side to store information
   about user's messages.  This results in much reduced mail server traffic
   and requires the server to parse the structure of every message only once.
   The tradeoff is your cache backend must be able to handle the potentially
   large amounts of cached data this option will produce. However, cache
   storage is potentially cheap when compared to the performance gained by
   using caching.

   To use this caching, you must have a ``Cache System`` configured in Horde's
   ``Administration/Configuration`` screen and have the relevant settings
   enabled in IMP's configuration screen
   (``Administration/Configuration/Webmail/Mailbox``).


Dynamic View Troubleshooting
============================

IMP's dynamic, AJAX-based view (formerly known as DIMP) differs from
traditional Horde applications in that it requires javascript support; in
fact, javascript performs the bulk of the page display.  As such, debugging
the dynamic view is more complex than with other Horde applications.

If you run into problems with the dynamic view, first follow the
troubleshooting steps for Horde - namely checking PHP error logs and Horde
debug logs to determine if the problem is located there.  Server-based errors
will be logged in the traditional manner.

Only if traditional debugging is unsuccessful will you need to move to
javascript debugging.  It is highly recommended to use Mozilla Firefox with
the `Firebug`_ extension installed in order to better track javascript
errors - it is what the developers use and makes deciphering error codes and
error line numbers much easier.  You will also want to turn off javascript
caching, if on, in ``horde/conf/conf.php``.

If you do find a javascript error, it would be great if you could fix the
issue and provide a patch :)  Absent that, before reporting to the mailing
list, IRC room, or bug tracker make sure you have a valid javascript error,
the file the error is being caused in, the line number of the error, and a
reliable way to reproduce the error.  Developers/other interested folks will
be much more likely to help you if all this information is provided.


Mobile View
===========

IMP also offers a view optimized for mobile devices that contains no graphics,
minimal styling, and a reduced feature set (formerly known as MIMP).
