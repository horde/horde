Tips on performance tuning systems for IMP.  See `horde/docs/PERFORMANCE`_
for general performance tips for Horde.


* Consider an IMAP proxy for more persistent connections.  Some IMAP proxies
  are up-imapproxy_ and Perdition_.

  up-imapproxy is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - especially versions 1.2.7rc1 and
  greater which contains features used internally by Horde to speed up
  access to the remote server.

* Some IMAP servers (or IMAP mailbox store formats) perform better than
  others.  Consider switching to a faster format if needed.

* Follow the IMAP servers' performance hints:

  - Cyrus: http://www.cyrusimap.org/docs/cyrus-imapd/2.4.2/install-perf.php
  - Cyrus: http://git.cyrusimap.org/cyrus-imapd/tree/doc/install-perf.html
  - Dovecot: http://wiki.dovecot.org/PerformanceTuning


* IMP can use persistent caching on the server side to store information
  about user's messages.  This results in much reduced mail server traffic
  and requires the server to parse the structure of every message only once.
  The tradeoff is your cache backend must be able to handle the potentially
  large amounts of cached data this option will produce. However, cache
  storage is potentially cheap when compared to the performance gained by
  using caching.

  To use this caching, you must have a ``Cache System`` configured in Horde's
  ``Administration/Configuration`` screen and have the relevant settings
  enabled in IMP's configuration screen
  (``Administration/Configuration/Webmail/Mailbox``).
