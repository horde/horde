General instructions
====================

These are instructions to upgrade from earlier IMP versions. Please backup your
existing data before running any of the steps described below. You can't use
the updated data with your old IMP version anymore.

Upgrading IMP is as easy as running::

   pear upgrade -a -B horde/imp

If you want to upgrade from an IMP version prior to 5.0, please follow
the instructions in INSTALL_ to install the most recent IMP version
using the PEAR installer.

After updating to a newer IMP version, you **always** need to update
configurations and database schemes. Log in as an administrator, go to
Administration => Configuration and update anything that's highlighted as
outdated.

The 'trailer' hook now has two additional parameters in addition to the
previously existing $html parameter: $identity and $to. Further details on
the content of these parameters can be found in hooks.php.dist.



Upgrading IMP From 6.0.x To 6.1
===============================

Server Options (backends.php)
-----------------------------

Sorting on non-IMAP servers, or IMAP servers that do not support the SORT
extension, has been disabled by default in IMP 6.1. To restore the old
behavior (NOT RECOMMENDED), see the 'sort_force' option in
``config/backends.local.php``.

The 'debug' option has been added to the SMTP configuration.

IMAP/POP caching can now be done using database backends (see documentation
for the 'cache' parameter).

The following quota drivers have been removed::

   Command
   Maildir
   Mdaemon
   Mercury32
   Sql


Configuration Options (conf.php)
--------------------------------

The $conf['user']['allow_folders'] option has been removed. This can now be
set per-backend using the Horde permissions system.

The $conf['server']['fixed_folders'] option has been removed. Preventing
actions on a specific mailbox can be controlled via native IMAP ACLs or,
alternatively, by the 'mbox_acl' hook.

The $conf['user']['autocreate_special'] option has been removed. This can now
be set on a per-backend basis in ``config/backends.local.php``
('autocreate_special' option).

The $conf['msgsettings']['filtering'] and $conf['msgsettings']['replacement']
options have been removed. This feature has been moved to the 'msg_filter'
hook.

The following spam-reporting options have been removed and can now be
configured per-backend in ``config/backends.local.php``::

word checking code that previously was provided as an example in the
'pre_sent' hook.

The 'compose_attach' hook has been removed and replaced by the
'compose_attachment' hook. Both hooks are designed for the same purpose;
however, the arguments have been completely changed so it is safest to
entirely deprecate usage of the previous hook.

The 'mbox_readonly' hook has been removed. Mailbox permissions can instead be
controlled via native IMAP ACLs or, alternatively, by the 'mbox_acl' hook.

The 'mbox_special' hook has been removed. Additional special mailboxes can
now be defined per-backend in ``config/backends.local.php``.

The 'mailboxarray' and 'msglist_flags' hooks have been altered to remove the
second argument ($mode). If the current view mode is needed, it can be
obtained via a call to $GLOBALS['registry']->getView().

The 'spam_email' hook has been removed. This configuration can now be defined
per-backend in ``config/backends.local.php``.

The $html argument to the 'trailer' hook has been added.

The following hooks have been added::

Preferences (prefs.php)
-----------------------

The default values for these preferences have been changed::

   request_mdn

The following preferences are no longer used and may be safely removed from

-----------------------------

The 'namespace' option now requires the namespaces to be in the UTF-8 charset,
not UTF7-IMAP.

changing the sentmail mailbox, the 'sent_mail_folder' preference should be
locked instead.

The following configuration options were removed::

   $conf['dimp']['viewport']['buffer_pages']
   $conf['dimp']['viewport']['viewport_wait']


MIME Viewer Options (mime_drivers.php)
--------------------------------------

=============================

This is a non-exhaustive, quick explanation of what has changed between an IMP
4.x installation to IMP 5.x.


HTML GUI editor
---------------

IMP only supports the CKeditor javascript HTML rich text editor.  Xinha is no
longer supported.

Button configuration is now stored in the prefs value 'ckeditor_buttons'.


Server Options (backends.php; OLD servers.php)
----------------------------------------------

The format of servers.php has changed and has been renamed to backends.php.

The 'realm' option has been removed.  Altering usernames at runtime should
instead by accomplished by using Horde's 'authusername' and/or IMP's

Configuration Options (conf.php)
--------------------------------

Hooks (hooks.php)
-----------------

information.

The 'vinfo' hook has been removed.  Use Horde's 'authusername' and/or IMP's
'preauthenticate' hooks instead.

The 'msglist_format' hook has been removed.  X-Priority header handling is now
handled in the core IMP code.  Attachment icon display is now handled by the
'atc_flag' preference.  The 'msglist_flags' hook is now used to dynamically
set flags on messages.


Custom Message Headers (OLD header.php)
---------------------------------------

The header.php configuration file has been removed.  Setting custom headers
is now done in the 'pre_sent' hook.


Custom Message Trailers (OLD trailer.txt)
-----------------------------------------

The trailer.txt file has been removed.  Setting message trailers is now done
in the 'trailer' hook.


Fetchmail
---------

All code relating to fetchmail has been removed.


Flags
-----

The list of available IMAP Flags/Keywords is now configurable via the
'msgflags' preference.

by default - these flags have special meanings and are automatically handled
by the various message action functions instead.


Menu
----

The dynamic view (DIMP) no longer supports the 'action' parameter located
in config/menu.php.


Portal
------

Portal rendering has been moved to Horde - config/portal.php is no longer
needed or used.



Upgrading IMP From 4.1.x To 4.2.x
=================================

This is a non-exhaustive, quick explanation of what has changed between an IMP
4.1.x installation to IMP 4.2.x.


SQL Backend
-----------

An SQL table has been added that can be used to track sent messages. This is
necessary to provide users with the "favourite recipients" address book, and
for message rate throttling.

Execute the provided SQL script to add the table to your database, e.g.::

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password> <db name> < scripts/sql/imp.sql


Unified IMAP Quota Driver
-------------------------

Separate quota drivers for Cyrus and Courier servers are no longer
necessary. These drivers have been replaced by a generic IMAP driver that
should also be suitable for other IMAP servers that support the QUOTA
extension. Update ``config/servers.php`` and change the 'quota' => 'driver'
setting to 'imap'.


Application Hooks
-----------------

All hooks that are specific to IMP have been moved from the
``horde/config/hooks.php`` file. Move your existing IMP Hooks from there to
``imp/config/hooks.php``.


User-Defined Mailbox Icons
--------------------------

The usage of the hook ``_imp_hook_mbox_icons()`` has changed.  If you use this
hook, make sure you change your implementation so it returns the correct
value.


Changed Preferences
-------------------

The default values for the mailbox preferences 'sent_mail_folder',
'drafts_folder', and 'trash_folder' have been changed and localized. Use the
old values to prohibit the creation of duplicate mailboxes for users that
didn't explicitly set the mailboxes in their preferences.

The following preferences are no longer used and may be safely removed from
your ``config/prefs.php`` file and your preferences backend::

   'auto_expand'
   'num_words'

The 'mail_hdr' preferences has been moved from the identities to a regular
preference. Existing user preferences are no longer used and have to be
re-created by the users.


New Message List Format Hook
----------------------------

The new hook ``_imp_hook_msglist_format()`` has been added which allows the
formatting of a message entry in the mailbox message list to be altered
at the time the list is created.  This hook has made the following
configuration options obsolete::

   $conf['mailbox']['show_attachments']
   $conf['mailbox']['show_xpriority']

If you wish to continue using the functionality previously provided by these
options, you should activate the msglist_format hook in ``config/conf.php``.
The sample hook contained in ``config/hooks.php`` contains the code necessary
to replicate the previous behavior.


Spell Checking
--------------

The ``pspell`` driver is no longer supported since it does not work with
HTML messages.  If using pspell, you must upgrade to aspell version 0.60+.


Javascript HTML Editor
----------------------

Support has been added for FCKeditor as an option for the javascript HTML
editor available on the compose page.  You must have Horde 3.2 or later
installed to use this editor.



Upgrading IMP From 4.0.x To 4.1.x
=================================

This is a non-exhaustive, quick explanation of what has changed between an IMP
4.0.x installation to IMP 4.1.x.


Automatic Namespace Detection
-----------------------------

The ``namespace``, ``hierarchies``, ``folders``, ``delimiter``, and
``dotfiles`` parameters were removed from ``config/servers.php``.  Namespaces
are now automatically configured pursuant to RFC 2342.

If using the UW IMAP daemon, you may notice a bunch of additional namespaces
that were not displayed before as well as the ability of the user to
view all files that live in their home directory via the folders screen.
Information on how to correct your IMAP server configuration can be found at

  http://wiki.horde.org/ImpUWIMAPNamespaces


User-Defined Headers
--------------------

The ``config/headers.txt`` file has been removed and replaced by
``config/headers.php``.  Any user-defined headers should be migrated to this
file.  The new file has the advantage of allowing any valid PHP expression
to be executed at run-time when generating the headers.  See the top of
the ``headers.php`` file for the new format required.


Removed Preferences
-------------------

The following preferences are no longer used and may be safely removed from
your ``config/prefs.php`` file and your preferences backend::

   'disposition_request_delivery'
   'wrap_width'


Virtual Folders
---------------

The format for saved Virtual Folders has changed.  To convert to the new
format you must run the script located at
``scripts/upgrades/convert_vfolders.php``.
