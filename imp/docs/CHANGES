      do them on a one-time basis by editing the From: line in the compose
      screen.
[jon] Retired $conf['user']['allow_filters'].  Administratively locking the
      'filters' preference produces the same behavior.

      see if a contact manager is registered with Horde, and link to it if
      it is.

[cjh] Fix all checks against the protocol to use strstr, so they work
      against either imap or imap/ssl and pop3 or pop3/ssl.
[cjh] Simplify a bit of the MIME stuff - go off of the Content-Disposition
      of parts most of the time, with just an option to never show parts

      incorrectly requested.
[cjh] $conf['server']['to_domain'] is now gone, along with
      $servers['foo']['to_host'], $servers['foo']['from_host'], and
      the maildomain prefs value. These are all now represented by
      $servers['foo']['maildomain']. Update your configurations accordingly.
[cjh] $conf['server']['namespace'] is gone, in favor of the use of
      $servers['foo']['namespace'].
[max] Allow selecting multiple fields in filters.

      back and parse the message to find it.
[cjh] When resuming or forwarding messages with attachments, don't duplicate
      parts.
[cjh] Everything in lib/IMP.php now lives inside the IMP:: class, and the
      phpdoc documentation is up to spec.
[cjh] Define an IMP_BASE constant used wherever including files to make sure
      that files are included relative to where IMP is in the filesystem. This
      allows IMP scripts to be included from other scripts in completely
      different hierarchies and still work.
[jon] Make sure ./config/trailer.txt is readable before we try to use it.
[cjh] Fix a couple of problems with imap subscriptions and utf7-encoded
      mailbox names.
[cjh] Move IMP_Folder::displayName() to IMP_Util::displayFolder(), as it is
      used in places that don't use the rest of the folders code.
[cjh] The login form now posts to redirect.php (renamed from
      remote_login.php) so as to avoid posting directly to the mailbox page.
      This avoids some problems with "Page Expired" errors.

[cjh] Selecting a language on the login screen now actually has an effect
[jon] Setting $conf['user']['initial_subscribe'] will automatically

[jon] The "cancel message" confirmation now cancel's the message if the user

------
v2.3.4
------

[cjh] The mailbox selects in the mailbox and message views now update in
      tandem (ie, if you change one, the other updates to the same selection).
[cjh] The login screen does not reload when you choose a new language, if a
      username or password has been entered.

      compose link and "add to contacts" link for each.
[cjh] Added $conf['hooks']['from_hook'] which implements building a from
      address based on a site-specific function. Yes, the implication is

[cjh] Added $conf['compose']['allow_(b)cc'] to control the availability of
      the cc: and bcc: fields.
[cjh] Added javascript to the message screen to make sure that a folder is
      selected before moving/copying a message
[jon] All generated URL's are now relative (URI's only), except for the
      Location: headers used for redirection.  They require fully-qualified
      URL's.
[cjh] If mailfrom() returns false, compose.php3 now at least tells the user
      there was an error instead of silently reloading.
[jon] Improved the entire newuser login procedure so that we correctly
      initialize their preferences with all of the default values.
[jon] Added checks for null preference results that would previously cause a

      mailbox view (in it's own new column).
[cjh] Started weeding out unneccesary uses of imap_msgno() when the function
      in question takes the FT_UID flag.
[cjh] Vastly improved the MIME attachment code. IMP now passes the MIME
      torture test.
[cjh] Fixed a javascript problem in the compose window where the last
      character before a space would be deleted incorrectly.
[cjh] Doctored the clickable-url functions for performance, and to not
      butcher included html code.
[cjh] Replaced all calls to ereg* functions with preg* functions, for speed.
      Because of this we now require php 3.0.12 or later.

------
v2.1.2
------

cjh: whomp. here we go.

Biggest change: session support through dbm files. YOU MUST touch the dbm
file (by default imp/lib/sessions) and give the webserver user read/write
permissions to it (actually, you don't have to create it if the webserver
has write access to the lib/ directory).

I've tested this will everything I can think of - server list, languages,
every page, etc. I think it works. I probably missed something. So please,
pound on it, fix it, make suggestions.


Also: I've taken a lot of cruft that wasn't being used out. imp.lib was
under 1000 lines for the first time in a while after this! I may prune more
v2 stuff if it's not used soon; that would trim us even more. I didn't trim
a whole lot from horde.


Cosmetic: the 'check inbox' option on the menu is gone (should probably
remove the lang strings - haven't done that) and it's replaced with a cute
little reload graphic at the top left of mailbox pages that lets you refresh
any mailbox that you're in. this is more consistent from a ui point of view.


Everything else: reformatting, minor changes/fixes/etc. Nothing noteworthy
enough to remember off of the top of my head.


To do: dump the mailbox_list functions into the new ImapSession object, or
*at least* rewrite them to take advantage of the new namespace objects that
are available. I haven't touched this one yet.

Comments?

------
v2.1.1
------

Enhancements:
  * Imp now undestands French (thanks to Mathieu Clabaut <clabault@multimania.com>)
  * Attachments are now indicated with a paperclip in the regular status column
  * New mail for each folder is listed in folder listing
  * You can configure the "from" server on a per-server basis w/servers.php3 now
  * Imp has help links in the contacts window

Bug Fixes:
  * Fixed a bug in the contacts that was causing Javascript errors
  * Fixed bug in forward mail case with mail that was missing headers
  * Fixed a bug where replying to mail caused errors and warnings

------
v2.0.3
------

There were a bunch of changes, but nobody updated this file

-------------------------
New and notable in 2.0.1:
-------------------------

Several pieces of IMP have been moved into the Horde module.  They include the
signup feature, problem reporting, the help functions, and faq management.

A new motd feature has been added.  You can now use the file called MOTD.html
and put in information you want shown under the login screen.  This file sits
in the config directory.

Extendable menus.  You can now easily add menu items by adding items to the
menu.txt file which resides in the config directory.

You can now set your session language at login.

A "new-user information" piece has been added to the login screen.  This
function provides new users with some basic background on using IMP.

A function was added to the compose window which does not allow you to send
a piece of email if you have browsed a file attachment but haven't attached
it yet.

Help items were added to the compose window.

Fixed several issues with multiple read/write imap openings. Now only
calls that require read/write use read/write.

Fixed multiple append trailer/footer bugs.

Localized the setup.php3 process.

Updated lynx pages so lynx works again with IMP
