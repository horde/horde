The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet Mail
Program (IMP) version H4 (5.0.15).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and traditional
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients. For more information on IMP, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H4 (5.0.14) are:
    * Added preference to mark deleted messages as seen.
    * Improve privacy protection when viewing message.
    * Improve performance when loading contacts.
    * Fix access to certain POP3 servers.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
