The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet Mail
Program (IMP) version H4 (5.0.22).

Thanks to Mike Cardwell (https://grepular.com/) for reporting the SVG
vulnerability.

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and traditional
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients. For more information on IMP, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H4 (5.0.21) are:
    * Only display basic image attachments in the browser to avoid XSS
      vulnerabilities triggered by opening malicious SVG attachments.
    * Re-added option to report messages as spam/ham through redirection.
    * Updated Swedish and Turkish translations.
