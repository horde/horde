The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Internet
Mail Program (IMP) version H5 (6.1.0).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and basic
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients. For more information on IMP, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The major changes compared to the IMP H5 (6.0) versions are:
    * Added message thread view to dynamic mailbox preview.
    * Support drag & drop of attachments, linking attachments, attaching PGP
      public keys, and attaching vCards in dynamic view.
    * Allow drag & drop, uploading, and pasting of images into the HTML editor.
    * Display Virtual Folders in smartphone view.
    * Added attachment uploading and saving compose drafts to smartphone view.
    * Added taphold message action menu to smartmobile mailbox page.
    * Allow HTML trailers for messages.
    * Allow to set special mailboxes, spam reporting, and permissions per
      backend.
    * Added support for NoSQL caching and logging backends.
    * Many further improvements.
