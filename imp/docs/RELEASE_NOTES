The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet Mail
Program (IMP) version H5 (6.1.6).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and basic
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients. For more information on IMP, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

For upgrading instructions, please see

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see

The major changes compared to IMP version H5 (6.1.5) are:
    * Fixed regressions in permissions, deleting drafts, and applying ACLs.
