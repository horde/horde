The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet Mail
Program (IMP) version H5 (6.0.4).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and basic
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients. For more information on IMP, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H5 (6.0.3) are:
    * Improved compatibility with Internet Explorer 8.
    * Improved compatibility with broken messages generated by Outlook.
    * Hide attachment upload UI in dynamic view if file uploads are disabled.
    * Many bugfixes and improvements.
