The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the
Internet Mail Program (IMP) version H5 (6.2.0).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides dynamic, mobile, basic, and
minimal interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop
email clients. For more information on IMP, visit
http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as IMP H5 (6.2.0).  We
encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, strings should not
change before the final release.
