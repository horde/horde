IMP is the Internet Messaging Program, a PHP-based webmail system and a
component of the Horde project.  IMP, once installed, accesses mail over IMAP
thus requiring little to no special preparations on the server on which mail
is stored.

IMP offers most of the features users have come to expect from their
conventional mail programs, including attachments, spell-check, address books,
multiple folders, and multiple-language support.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.
