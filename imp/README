IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and traditional
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients, including attachments, spell-check, address books, multiple mailboxes,
and multiple-language support.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.
