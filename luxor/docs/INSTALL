==========================
|| INSTALLING Luxor 0.1 ||
==========================

This document contains instructions for installing the Luxor web-based
luxor application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Luxor, see the file
README in the top-level directory of the Luxor distribution.


OBTAINING Luxor
------------------

Luxor can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/apps/luxor
   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/luxor/

Bleeding-edge development versions of Luxor are available via CVS; see
the file docs/HACKING in the Horde distribution for information on
accessing the Horde CVS repository.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

To function properly, Luxor requires the following:

  1. A working Horde installation.

     Luxor runs within the Horde Application Framework, a set of
     common tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must
     install Horde before installing Luxor.

     The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and
     FTP server, at

        http://www.horde.org/apps/horde
        ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

     Many of Luxor's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.
     Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the INSTALL
     file for the Horde Framework before installing Luxor.

  2. SQL support in PHP.

     Luxor store its data in an SQL database. Build PHP with whichever
     SQL driver you require; see the Horde INSTALL file for details.


INSTALLING Luxor
-------------------

Luxor is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from
system to system. Conventionally, Luxor is installed directly underneath
Horde in the webserver's document tree.

Since Luxor is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary;
simply expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename
the root directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear
in the URL. For example, with the Apache webserver's default document
root of '/usr/local/apache/htdocs', you would type:

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/luxor-1.0.tar.gz
   mv luxor-1.0 luxor

and would then find Luxor at the URL

   http://your-server/horde/luxor/


CONFIGURING Luxor
--------------------

1. Configuring Horde for Luxor

   a. Register the application

      In horde/config/registry.php, find the applications['luxor'] stanza.
      The 'status' parameter should already be marked '=> active'.
      If you have changed the location of Luxor relative to Horde,
      either in the URL or in the filesystem or both, you must
      update the 'fileroot' and 'webroot' settings to their correct
      values.

2. Creating the database table

   The specific steps to create the Luxor database table depend
   on which database you've chosen to use.

   First, look in scripts/sql/ to see if a script already
   exists for your database type. If so, you should be
   able to simply execute that script as superuser in your
   database. (Note that executing the script as the "horde" user will
   probably fail when granting privileges.)

   If such a script does not exist, you'll need to build your own, using
   the file luxor.sql as a starting point. If you need
   assistance in creating databases, you may wish to let us know on
   the Luxor mailing list.

3. Configuring Luxor.

   To configure Luxor, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and copy the ``backends.php.dist`` configuration file to
   ``backends.php`` and edit it to your needs.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the configuration files in the
   ``config/`` directory can be found in each file.  You may edit these files
   if you wish to customize Luxor's appearance and behavior.  The defaults
   will be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuring of Luxor.  Use the Horde "Administration" menu item to get
   to the Administration page, and then click on the "Configuration"
   icon to get the Configuration page.  Select "Luxor" from the selection
   list of applications, and click on the "Configure" button.  Fill in or
   change any configuration values as needed.  When done click on "Generate
   Luxor Configuration" to generate the conf.php file.  If your web server
   doesn't have write permissions to the Luxor configuration directory or
   file, it will not be able to write the file.  In this case, cut and
   paste the returned configuration information into the file
   luxor/config/conf.php.

   Note for international users:  Luxor uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are
   found in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available
   for your locale (and you wish to create one), or if you're having
   trouble using a provided translation, please see the horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS
   file for instructions.
