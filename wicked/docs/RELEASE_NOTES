The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Wicked
wiki application version H4 (1.0-RC1).

Wicked is a wiki application for the Horde Framework. It uses PEAR's Text_Wiki
library for the actual wiki markup parsing and rendering. It supports Creole,
Mediawiki, Tiki Wiki, and its own markup engine.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Wicked H4 (1.0).
Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

Major changes compared to the Wicked version H4 (1.0-ALPHA1) are:
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.
