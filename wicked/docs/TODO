==============================
 Wicked Development TODO List
==============================

- Allow for daily summaries of changed/added content, and figure out some way
  to categorize changes in a structure for sanity with large sites.

- Lots of ideas/references: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki,
  http://twistedmatrix.com/users/jh.twistd/moin/moin.cgi/FrontPage

- Allow customizations for specific uses like collaborative content,
  (editing, notes, annotations, etc.), encyclopedias (glossaries, etc.),
  FAQ, and so on.

- Provide a mechanism to easily annotate (insert a (possibly signed) comment
  at any point in the page.

- Also, an easy 'Reply' feature, allowing the user to select text and reply
  to it in thread mode.

- Ability to generate a backup of the whole wiki (zipfile or otherwise).

- Ability to generate a static HTML version of the wiki.

- Ability to purge all page history (just leaving the current version).

- Help pages (any page that starts with Help).

- Find a way to keep old versions of deleted pages?

- Export pages to PDF.

- Some method to associate users with homepages.

- Horde_Driver_sql::getBackLinks() will incorrectly match a WikiWord in a
  ((...))-style link.

- Make RecentChanges use page_id to track changes accross renames.

- Make permissions based on page_id, not page_name, so we don't loose
  permissions when a page is renamed.

- When pages are merged, merge attachments as well.

- Add a page_content_type, which is a MIME type.  Editors can be registered
  and we use the Horde_Mime packages for display.  This way we can have wiki
  images, and we can have other apps register handlers.

- Support for reStructuredText.

- Could start very basic: a new content-type "book" or "areamap", like
  YaWiki's areamap
  (http://wiki.ciaweb.net/yawiki/index.php?area=Sandbox&page=AreaMap, thanks
  to Paul Jones for the reference)

- Ability to export a book to PDF.
