+ Sample Page for Text_Wiki Default Markup

[[toc]]

----

++ General Notes

The markup described on this page is for the default {{Text_Wiki}} rules; \
it is a combination of the [http://tavi.sourceforge.net WikkTikkiTavi] \
and [http://develnet.org/ coWiki] markup styles.

All text is entered as plain text, and will be converted to HTML entities as \
necessary.  This means that {{<}}, {{>}}, {{&}}, and so on are converted for \
you (except in special situations where the characters are Wiki markup; \
Text_Wiki is generally smart enough to know when to convert and when not to).

Just hit "return" twice to make a paragraph break.  If you want \
to keep the same logical line but have to split it across \
two physical lines (such as when your editor only shows a certain number \
of characters per line), end the line with a backslash {{\}} and hit \
return once.  This will cause the two lines to be joined on display, and the \
backslash will not show.  (If you end a line with a backslash and a tab \
or space, it will ''not'' be joined with the next line, and the backslash \
will be printed.)

++ Inline Formatting

|| {{``//emphasis text//``}}                 || //emphasis text// ||
|| {{``**strong text**``}}                   || **strong text** ||
|| {{``//**emphasis and strong**//``}}       || //**emphasis and strong**// ||
|| {{``{{teletype text}}``}}                    || {{teletype text}} ||
|| {{``@@--- delete text +++ insert text @@``}} || @@--- delete text +++ insert text @@ ||
|| {{``@@--- delete only @@``}}                 || @@--- delete only @@ ||
|| {{``@@+++ insert only @@``}}                 || @@+++ insert only @@ ||
|| {{``##red|red text## ``}} || ##red|red text## ||
|| {{``##FFFF00|yellow text##``}} || ##FFFF00|yellow text## ||

++ Literal Text

If you don't want Text_Wiki to parse some text, enclose it in two backticks (not single-quotes).

<code>

This //text// gets **parsed**.

``This //text// does not get **parsed**.``

</code>

This //text// gets **parsed**.

``This //text// does not get **parsed**.``

----

++ Headings

You can make various levels of heading by putting \
plus-signs before the text (all on its own line):

<code>
+++ Level 3 Heading
++++ Level 4 Heading
+++++ Level 5 Heading
++++++ Level 6 Heading
</code>

+++ Level 3 Heading
++++ Level 4 Heading
+++++ Level 5 Heading
++++++ Level 6 Heading

----

++ Table of Contents

To create a list of every heading, with a link to that heading, put a table of contents tag on its own line.

<code>
[[toc]]
</code>

----

++ Horizontal Rules

Use four dashes ({{``----``}}) to create a horizontal rule.

----

++ Lists

+++ Bullet Lists

You can create bullet lists by starting a paragraph with one or \
more asterisks.

<code>
* Bullet one
 * Sub-bullet
</code>

* Bullet one
 * Sub-bullet

+++ Numbered Lists

Similarly, you can create numbered lists by starting a paragraph \
with one or more hashes.

<code>
# Numero uno
# Number two
 # Sub-item
</code>

# Numero uno
# Number two
 # Sub-item


+++ Mixing Bullet and Number List Items

You can mix and match bullet and number lists:

<code>
# Number one
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
# Number two
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
  * Sub-bullet
   # Sub-sub-number
   # Sub-sub-number
# Number three
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
</code>

# Number one
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
# Number two
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
  * Sub-bullet
   # Sub-sub-number
   # Sub-sub-number
# Number three
 * Bullet
 * Bullet



+++ Definition Lists

You can create a definition (description) list with the following syntax:

<code>
: Item 1 : Something
: Item 2 : Something else
</code>

: Item 1 : Something
: Item 2 : Something else

----

++ Block Quotes

You can mark a blockquote by starting a line with one or more '>' \
characters, followed by a space and the text to be quoted.

<code>
This is normal text here.

> Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \ 
Now this the time for all good men to come to the aid of \ 
their country. Notice how we can continue the block-quote \ 
in the same "paragraph" by using a backslash at the end of \ 
the line.
>
> Another block, leading to...
>> Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even \ 
more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.
</code>

++ Links and Images

+++ Wiki Links

SmashWordsTogether to create a page link.

You can force a WikiPage name '''not''' to be clickable by putting \
an exclamation mark in front of it.

<code>
WikiPage !WikiPage
</code>

WikiPage !WikiPage

You can create a "described" or "labeled" link to a wiki page by putting the page name in brackets, followed by some text.

<code>
[WikiPage Descriptive text for the link.]
</code>

[WikiPage Descriptive text for the link.]

> **Note:** existing wiki pages must be in the [RuleWikilink wikilink] {{pages}} configuration,  and the [RuleWikilink wikilink] {{view_url}} configuration value must be set for the linking to work.

+++ Interwiki Links

Interwiki links are links to pages on other Wiki sites. \
Type the {{``SiteName:PageName``}} like this:

* MeatBall:RecentChanges
* Advogato:proj/WikkiTikkiTavi
* Wiki:WorseIsBetter

> **Note:** the interwiki site must be in the [RuleInterwiki interwiki] {{sites}} configuration array.

+++ URLs

Create a remote link simply by typing its URL: http://ciaweb.net.

If you like, enclose it in brackets to create a numbered reference \
and avoid cluttering the page; {{``[http://ciaweb.net/free/]``}} becomes [http://ciaweb.net/free/].

Or you can have a described-reference instead of a numbered reference:
<code>
[http://pear.php.net PEAR]
</code>
[http://pear.php.net PEAR]

+++ On-Page Links

Create and anchor on the page by {{``[[# anchorName nice anchor text]]``}} [[# anchorName nice anchor text]] and refer to it by {{``#anchorName``}} #anchorName, or {{``[#anchorName use normal link renaming]``}} [#anchorName use normal link renaming].

+++ Images

You can put a picture in a page with {{``[[image foo.jpg]]``}}. You can use any file type, but most browsers only support GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats. The filename can either be a relative reference (in which case the wiki looks for a file attached to the current page - or a different wiki page if the file name is prefixed with a page name, e.g. {{``[[image WikiHome:foo.jpg]]``}}), an absolute reference which begins with a slash (in which case the wiki uses it to retrieve a file relative to the web server's root), or a full, external URL.

Additonal attributes, such as "alt" can follow the image filename or URL like so: {{``[[image foo.jpg alt="A Foo JPEG"]]``}}.  "link" is a special attribute which makes the image a link to the specified URL.

----

++ Code Blocks

Create code blocks by using {{<code>...</code>}} tags (each on its own line).

<code>
This is an example code block!
</code>


To create PHP blocks that get automatically colorized when you use PHP tags, simply surround the code with {{<code type="php">...</code>}} tags (the tags themselves should each be on their own lines, and no need for the {{<?php ... ?>}} tags).

<code>
 <code type="php">
 // Set up the wiki options
 $options = array();
 $options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

 // load the text for the requested page
 $text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

 // create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
 $wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

 // transform the wiki text.
 echo $wiki->transform($text);
 </code>
</code>

<code type="php">
// Set up the wiki options
$options = array();
$options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

// load the text for the requested page
$text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

// create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
$wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

// transform the wiki text.
echo $wiki->transform($text);
</code>

----

++ Tables

You can create tables using pairs of vertical bars:

<code>
||~ Heading one ||~ Heading two ||
|| cell one || cell two ||
|||| big ol' line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||
</code>

||~ Heading one ||~ Heading two ||
|| cell one || cell two ||
|||| big ol' line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||

<code>
|| lines must start and end || with double vertical bars || nothing ||
|| cells are separated by || double vertical bars || nothing ||
|||| you can span multiple columns by || starting each cell ||
|| with extra cell |||| separators ||
|||||| but perhaps an example is the easiest way to see ||
