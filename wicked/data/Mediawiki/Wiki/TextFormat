= Sample Page for Wiki Markup =

[[toc]]


== General Notes ==

The markup uses the [http://www.mediawiki.org/ Mediawiki] style.

All text is entered as plain text, and will be converted to HTML entities as \
necessary.  This means that <tt><</tt>, <tt>></tt>, <tt>&</tt>, and so on are converted for \
you (except in special situations where the characters are Wiki markup; \
the Wiki is generally smart enough to know when to convert and when not to).

Just hit "return" twice to make a paragraph break.  If you want \
to keep the same logical line but have to split it across \
two physical lines (such as when your editor only shows a certain number \
of characters per line), end the line with a backslash <tt>\</tt> and hit \
return once.  This will cause the two lines to be joined on display, and the \
backslash will not show.  (If you end a line with a backslash and a tab \
or space, it will ''not'' be joined with the next line, and the backslash \
will be printed.)


== Inline Formatting ==

{|
| <tt><nowiki>''emphasis text''</nowiki></tt>
| ''emphasis text''
|-
| <tt><nowiki>'''strong text'''</nowiki></tt>
| '''strong text'''
|-
| <tt><nowiki>'''''emphasis and strong'''''</nowiki></tt>
| '''''emphasis and strong'''''
|-
| <tt><nowiki><tt>teletype text</tt></nowiki></tt>
| <tt>teletype text</tt>
|-
| <tt><nowiki><sub>subscript</sub> text</nowiki></tt>
| <sub>subscript</sub> text
|-
| <tt><nowiki><sup>superscript</sup> text</nowiki></tt>
| <sup>superscript</sup> text
|}

== Literal Text ==

If you don't want the wiki to parse some text, enclose it in <tt><nowiki><nowiki>...</nowiki></nowiki></tt> tags.

<code>
This ''text'' gets '''parsed'''.

<nowiki>This ''text'' does not get '''parsed'''.</nowiki>
</code>

This ''text'' gets '''parsed'''.

<nowiki>This ''text'' does not get '''parsed'''.</nowiki>


== Comments ==

You can add comments to the page source code using the following markup. These comments won't be rendered in the page's output.

<code>
<!-- Some comment -->
</code>

<!-- Some comment -->


== Headings ==

You can make various levels of heading by putting \
plus-signs before the text (all on its own line):

<code>
=== Level 3 Heading ===
==== Level 4 Heading ====
===== Level 5 Heading =====
====== Level 6 Heading ======
</code>

=== Level 3 Heading ===
==== Level 4 Heading ====
===== Level 5 Heading =====
====== Level 6 Heading ======


== Table of Contents ==

To create a list of every heading, with a link to that heading, put a table of contents tag on its own line.

<code>
[[toc]]
</code>


== Horizontal Rules ==

Use four dashes (<tt><nowiki>----</nowiki></tt>) to create a horizontal rule.

----


== Lists ==


=== Bullet Lists ===

You can create bullet lists by starting a paragraph with one or \
more asterisks.

<code>
* Bullet one
** Sub-bullet
</code>

* Bullet one
** Sub-bullet


=== Numbered Lists ===

Similarly, you can create numbered lists by starting a paragraph \
with one or more hashes.

<code>
# Numero uno
# Number two
## Sub-item
</code>

# Numero uno
# Number two
## Sub-item


=== Mixing Bullet and Number List Items ===

You can mix and match bullet and number lists:

<code>
# Number one
** Bullet
** Bullet
# Number two
** Bullet
** Bullet
*** Sub-bullet
#### Sub-sub-number
#### Sub-sub-number
# Number three
** Bullet
** Bullet
</code>

# Number one
** Bullet
** Bullet
# Number two
** Bullet
** Bullet
*** Sub-bullet
#### Sub-sub-number
#### Sub-sub-number
# Number three
** Bullet
** Bullet


=== Definition Lists ===

You can create a definition (description) list with the following syntax:

<code>
;Item 1
:Something
;Item 2
:Something else
</code>

;Item 1
:Something
;Item 2
:Something else


== Block Quotes ==

You can mark a blockquote by starting a line with one or more '>' \
characters, followed by a space and the text to be quoted.

<code>
This is normal text here.

: Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \
Now this the time for all good men to come to the aid of \
their country. Notice how we can continue the block-quote \
in the same "paragraph" by using a backslash at the end of \
the line.

: Another block, leading to...
:: Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even \
more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.
</code>

the line.

more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.


== Links and Images ==


=== Wiki Links ===

You can create page links by putting the name in brackets.

<code>
[[Wiki/Page]]
</code>

[[Wiki/Page]]

You can also use this format to create a "described" or "labeled" link or to add an anchor target.

<code>
[[Wiki/Page#anchor|Descriptive text for the link.]]
</code>

[[Wiki/Page#anchor|Descriptive text for the link.]]


=== URLs ===

Create a remote link simply by typing its URL: http://www.horde.org.

If you like, enclose it in brackets to create a numbered reference \
and avoid cluttering the page; <tt><nowiki>[http://www.horde.org/]</nowiki></tt> becomes [http://www.horde.org/].

''Rendering of URLs as numbers is broken as of Text_Wiki 1.2.1.''

Or you can have a described-reference instead of a numbered reference:

<code>
[http://www.horde.org Horde]
</code>

[http://www.horde.org Horde]


=== Images ===

You can put a picture in a page with <tt><nowiki>[[Image:foo.jpg]]</nowiki></tt>. You can use any file type, but most browsers only support GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats. The filename can either be a relative reference (in which case the wiki looks for a file attached to the current page - or a different wiki page if the file name is prefixed with a page name, e.g. <tt><nowiki>[[Image:SomePage:foo.jpg]]</nowiki></tt>), an absolute reference which begins with a slash (in which case the wiki uses it to retrieve a file relative to the web server's root), or a full, external URL.

Additional "alt", "width", and "height" attributes can follow the image filename or URL like so: <tt><nowiki>[[Image:foo.jpg|A Foo JPEG|WIDTHxHEIGHTpx]]</nowiki></tt>.


== Application Content ==

=== Application Blocks ===

Content from other Horde applications provided by portal blocks can be embedded into a page using <tt><nowiki>[[block]]</nowiki></tt> tags.

To include Horde's moon phases block for example:

<code>
[[block horde/Moon phase=next hemisphere=northern]]
</code>

[[block horde/Moon phase=next hemisphere=northern]]

=== Application Links ===

Links to other Horde applications is supported if those applications support API links. The Wiki itself supports such an API to link to individual wiki pages:

<code>
[[link Link to some other wiki page|wiki/show page=Wiki/Page]]
</code>

[[link Link to some other wiki page|wiki/show page=Wiki/Page]]


== Code Blocks ==

Create code blocks by using <tt>code</tt> tags (each on its own line).

<code>
This is an example code block!
</code>

To create PHP blocks that get automatically colorized when you use PHP tags, simply surround the code with <tt>code type="php"</tt> tags (the tags themselves should each be on their own lines, and no need for the <tt><?php ... ?></tt> tags).

<code>
 <code type="php">
 // Set up the wiki options
 $options = array();
 $options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

 // load the text for the requested page
 $text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

 // create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
 $wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

 // transform the wiki text.
 echo $wiki->transform($text);
 </code>
</code>

<code type="php">
// Set up the wiki options
$options = array();
$options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

// load the text for the requested page
$text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

// create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
$wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

// transform the wiki text.
echo $wiki->transform($text);
</code>

API references can be generated using <tt><function></tt> tags.

<code>
<function>
name:listUsers
access:public
param:string,Filter users by this string.,'USER'
returns:array
throws:Exception,if user backend not available.
</function>
</code>

''Rendering of this rule is broken as of Text_Wiki 1.2.1, usage is discouraged.''


== Tables ==

You can create tables using pairs of vertical bars:

<code>
{|
! Heading one !! Heading two
|-
| cell one || cell two
|-
| colspan="2" | big ol' line
|-
| cell four || cell five
|-
| cell six || here's a very long cell
|}
</code>

{|
! Heading one !! Heading two
|-
| cell one || cell two
|-
| colspan="2" | big ol' line
|-
| cell four || cell five
|-
| cell six || here's a very long cell
|}

<code>
{|
| lines must start || with a vertical bar || and a dash
|-
| cells are separated by || double vertical bars || nothing
|-
| or by starting the new
| cell on a new line
| with a vertical bar
|-
| colspan="2" | you can span multiple columns by || starting the cell
|-
| with a colspan || colspan="2" |  attribute
|-
| colspan="3" | but perhaps an example is the easiest way to see
|}
</code>
