[b][size=24]Sample Page for Wiki Markup[/size][/b]


[b][size=18]General Notes[/size][/b]

The markup uses the BBCode style.

This is a very limited markup syntax that is not really well suited for wikis.

Just hit "return" twice to make a paragraph break.  If you want \
to keep the same logical line but have to split it across \
two physical lines (such as when your editor only shows a certain number \
of characters per line), end the line with a backslash \ and hit \
return once.  This will cause the two lines to be joined on display, and the \
backslash will not show.  (If you end a line with a backslash and a tab \
or space, it will [i]not[/i] be joined with the next line, and the backslash \
will be printed.)

[b][size=18]Headings[/size][/b]

You can emulate various levels of heading by using "size" and "b" tags:

[code]
[b][size=14]Level 3 Heading[/size][/b]
[b][size=12]Level 4 Heading[/size][/b]
[b][size=10]Level 5 Heading[/size][/b]
[b][size=8]Level 6 Heading[/size][/b]
[/code]

[b][size=14]Level 3 Heading[/size][/b]
[b][size=12]Level 4 Heading[/size][/b]
[b][size=10]Level 5 Heading[/size][/b]
[b][size=8]Level 6 Heading[/size][/b]


[b][size=18]Lists[/size][/b]


[b][size=14]Bullet Lists[/size][/b]

You can create bullet lists by using "list" tags.

[code]
[list]
[*]Bullet one
 [list]
 [*] Sub-bullet
 [/list]
[/list]
[/code]

[list]
[*]Bullet one
 [list]
 [*] Sub-bullet

[b][size=14]Numbered Lists[/size][/b]

Similarly, you can create numbered lists.

[code]
[list=1]
[*] Numero uno
[*] Number two
 [list=1]
 [*] Sub-item
 [/list]
[/list]
[/code]

[list=1]
[*] Numero uno
[*] Number two
 [list=1]
 [*] Sub-item
 [/list]
[/list]


[b][size=14]Mixing Bullet and Number List Items[/size][/b]

You can mix and match bullet and number lists:

[code]
[list=1]
[*] Number one
 [list]
 [*] Bullet
 [*] Bullet
 [/list]
[*] Number two
 [list]
 [*] Bullet
 [*] Bullet
  [list]
  [*] Sub-bullet
   [list=1]
   [*] Sub-sub-number
   [*] Sub-sub-number
   [/list]
  [/list]
 [/list]
[*] Number three
 [list]
 [*] Bullet
 [*] Bullet
 [/list]
[/list]
[/code]

[list=1]
[*] Number one
 [list]
 [*] Bullet
 [*] Bullet
 [/list]
[*] Number two
 [list]
 [*] Bullet
 [*] Bullet
  [list]
  [*] Sub-bullet
   [list=1]
   [*] Sub-sub-number
   [*] Sub-sub-number
   [/list]
  [/list]
 [/list]
[*] Number three
 [list]
 [*] Bullet
 [*] Bullet
 [/list]
[/list]


[b][size=18]Block Quotes[/size][/b]

You can mark a blockquote using "quote" tags.

[code]
This is normal text here.

  [quote]Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \
  Now this the time for all good men to come to the aid of \
  their country. Notice how we can continue the block-quote \
  in the same "paragraph" by using a backslash at the end of \
  the line.
  [/quote]

  [quote]Another block, leading to...
    [quote]Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even \
    more than the previous one.
    [/quote]
  [/quote]

Back to normal text.
[/code]

[b][size=18]Links[/size][/b]


[b][size=14]Wiki Links[/size][/b]

You cannot create wiki links. You have to specify full URLs.


[b][size=14]URLs[/size][/b]

Create a remote link simply by typing its URL: http://www.horde.org.

If you like, enclose it in "url" tags:
[code]
[url]http://www.horde.org/[/url]
[/code]
becomes [url]http://www.horde.org/[/url].

Or you can have a described-reference instead:
[code]
[url=http://www.horde.org/]Horde[/url]
[/code]
[url=http://www.horde.org/]Horde[/url]

[i]Rendering of URLs using "url" tags is broken as of Text_Wiki 1.2.1, usage is discouraged.[/i]


[b][size=18]Application Content[/size][/b]

[b][size=14]Application Blocks[/size][/b]

Content from other Horde applications provided by portal blocks can be embedded into a page using [[block]] tags.

To include Horde's moon phases block for example:

[code]
[[block horde/Moon phase=next hemisphere=northern]]
[/code]

[[block horde/Moon phase=next hemisphere=northern]]

[b][size=14]Application Links[/size][/b]

Links to other Horde applications is supported if those applications support API links. The Wiki itself supports such an API to link to individual wiki pages:

[code]
[[link Link to some other wiki page|wiki/show page=Wiki/Page]]
[/code]

[[link Link to some other wiki page|wiki/show page=Wiki/Page]]


[b][size=18]Code Blocks[/size][/b]

Create code blocks by using "code" tags (each on its own line).

[code]
[code]
This is an example code block!
[/code]
[/code]
