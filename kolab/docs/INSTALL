This document contains instructions for installing the Kolab ...

For information on the capabilities and features of Kolab, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Kolab distribution.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Kolab **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Kolab runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common
   tools for web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Kolab.

   .. Important:: Kolab 1.0 requires version 5.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Kolab. Many of Kolab's prerequisites are
                  also Horde prerequisites. Additionally, many of Kolab's
                  optional features are configured via the Horde install.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/apps/horde

2. The following PHP capabilities:

   a. FOO support ``--with-foo`` [OPTIONAL]

      Description of Foo and what it is used for.

3. The following PEAR packages:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PEAR packages)

   .. Important:: If you are going to install Kolab the recommended way,
                  i.e. using the PEAR installer, you can skip the remainder of
                  this section. Installing Kolab through PEAR will
                  automatically download and install all required PEAR modules.

   a. PEAR_Package x.x.x [OPTIONAL]

      Kolab uses the Foo_Bar class for...

4. The following PECL modules:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PECL modules)

   a. pecl_package x.x.x [OPTIONAL]

      pecl_package is required to...


The following items are not required, but are strongly **RECOMMENDED**:

1. Yet something else.


Installing Kolab
===================

There are several ways to install Kolab. The recommended way to install
Kolab is using the PEAR installer. Alternatively it can be installed from
tarballs. Finally, if you want to run the latest development code, or get the
latest, not yet released, fixes, you can install Kolab from Git.


Installing with PEAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First follow the instructions in `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ to prepare a PEAR
environment for Horde and install the Horde Framework.

When installing Kolab through PEAR now, the installer will automatically
install any dependencies of Kolab too. If you want to install Kolab with
all optional dependencies, but without the binary PECL packages that need to be
compiled, specify both the ``-a`` and the ``-B`` flag::

   pear install -a -B horde/kolab

By default, only the required dependencies will be installed::

   pear install horde/kolab

If you want to install Kolab even with all binary dependencies, you need to
remove the ``-B`` flag. Please note that this might also try to install PHP
extensions through PECL that might need further configuration or activation in
your PHP configuration::

   pear install -a horde/kolab


Installing from Release Tarballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Important:: As of today, there are no tarballs released for Kolab 1
               yet. Please use the `Installing with PEAR`_ method to install
               Kolab 1.

Kolab can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/apps/kolab

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/kolab/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Kolab is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from system to
system. Conventionally, Kolab is installed directly underneath Horde in the
web server's document tree.

Since Kolab is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL. For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/kolab-h3-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv kolab-h3-x.y.z kolab

and would then find Kolab at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/kolab/


Configuring Kolab
====================

1. Configuring Kolab

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Kolab. Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to
   get to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration``
   icon to get the configuration page. Select ``Kolab Name`` from the
   selection list of applications. Fill in or change any configuration values
   as needed. When done click on ``Generate Kolab Name Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file. If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Kolab configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file. In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``kolab/config/conf.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the other configuration files in
   the ``config/`` directory can be found in each file. You may create
   ``*.local.php`` versions of these files if you wish to customize Kolab's
   appearance and behavior. See the header of the configuration files for
   details and examples. The defaults will be correct for most sites.

2. Creating the database tables

   Once you finished the configuration in the previous step, you can create all
   database tables by clicking the ``DB schema is out of date.`` link in the
   Kolab row of the configuration screen.

   Alternatively creating the Kolab database tables can be accomplished with
   horde's ``horde-db-migrate`` utility.  If your database is properly setup in
   the Horde configuration, just run the following::

      horde-db-migrate kolab

3. More instructions, upgrading, securing, etc.

4. Testing Kolab

   Once you have configured Kolab, bring up the included test page in your
   Web browser to ensure that all necessary prerequisites have been met. See
   the `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ document for further details on the Horde test
   script.

   The test script will also allow you to test...

   Next, use Kolab to.... Test at least the following:

   - Foo
   - Bar
