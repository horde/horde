      amavisd-new author expects to have support for these extensions
      in SQL in a development version soon.
[cjh] Add a VFS-based FTP driver for SpamAssassin user-dir config files

      (Devin Drown <drown@banzai.org>).

      adds to a user's SpamAssassin preferences.
[jan] Add Traditional Chinese translation (David Chang <david@thbuo.gov.tw>).
[cjh] Get rid of the horrid hardcoding of after @-stripping of the username,

[crb] Ok, created the initial form and retrieval framework for the
      'whitelist_from' preference.
[crb] Added whitelist.php
[crb] Added template/whitelist folder and template/whitelist/body.inc file.
[crb] Added getWhiteList($option) function to lib/SAM.php, this function will
      retrieve an array of email addresses from the 'spam_options' array and
      convert them into a string for a textarea box entry box.
[crb] Added setWhiteList($option, $value) function to lib/SAM.php, this
      function will convert the string of addresses recieved from the textarea
      entry box and convert them into an array, which is then stored in the
      'spam_options' array.
[crb] Added buildWhiteListQuery($preference, $value) to lib/Driver/sql.php,
      This function is used to build a list of commitable email addresses for
      the store function to action the commit.
[crb] Ok, the changes that I had made before to ensure that spamassassin get's
      a properly formatted username (seeing as it does not use a fully
      qualified email address for it's SQL queries) were removed I had to redo
      them.
[crb] Made modifications to the store function in lib/Driver/sql.php, allowing
      the store function to use the query generated by buildWhiteListQuery()
      to store 'whitelist_from' preference's.
[crb] Made modifications to the retrieve function in lib/Driver/sql.php to
      allow it to construct the array for the 'whitelist_from' preference
      entries.
[crb] Removed buildWhiteListQuery(...) function as it's no longer needed due to
      some changes made by Chuck.
[crb] Added deleteWhiteList($option) function to clear out a current list of
      white-listed email addresses.
[cjh] Lots of code and UI cleanup.
[crb] Made several modifications to the storage retrieval system to
      accommodate more options.
[mgf] Added subject_tag/rewrite_subject preferences to body.inc
[crb] Completed the addition of 4 more options, initially start by Marc.
      spam_level_stars, report_header, use_terse_report, defang_mime.
[crb] Changes retrieve and store in Driver/sql.php to accommodate adding more
      spam_options variables, such as those above. The functions are now smart
      enough to handle adding more variables and not need to change the
      functions each time.
[crb] Added some ground work for the help system.
[mgf] Using new ground work to implement some help listings.
[crb] Corrected a use_terse_report help tag, it was not displaying the help
      information.
[crb] Added the submission/retrieve code in spamassassin.php for each of the
      values defined. Initial ground work is now in place for adding
      white_list and black_list options, framework itself needs to be
      worked on.
[crb] Modified the submission order in spamassassin.php, some elements that
      required on or off states were not getting committed properly, this
      has been fixed.
[crb] Incremented version number.
[crb] Corrected bug with database structure. Horde uses the full email
      address as it's username, SpamAssassin does not, it only uses
      the prefix of an email address. I've added a column called horde_id
      which will store the horde username and the actual username column
      will store the stripped prefix so that SpamAssassin will work correctly.
[jan] Add Norwegian Nynorsk translation (Per-Stian Vatne <psv@orsta.org>).
[jan] Add French translation (Thierry Thomas <thierry@pompo.net>).
[cjh] Fix spelling of SpamAssassin (one word).
[cjh] Initial inport into Horde CVS.
[crb] Created initial framework layout, as described by various online
      documentation.
[crb] Created SQL template table from SpamAssassin's MySQL module.
[crb] Created "General Options" page, used for SpamAssassin's basic options.
[crb] Added first option, the means to change the "Required Hits" that
      triggers the spam warning.
[crb] Completed initial SQL driver specification, might need some changes as
      more features are added to the module.
[crb] Submission to the database works.
[crb] Retrieval from the database works.
[crb] Initial configuration file layout.
[crb] Some constents were added, need to clean up and clearify.
[crb] SpamAssassin module now shows up in my copy of the Horde menu's.
[crb] Added Installation documentation based on some of the other
      Horde modules.
[crb] Designated the official name of the module to be SAM.
[crb] Updated all the entries for any authoring copywrites.
[crb] Made changes to make "coding" fit into the Standard Style.
