============================================
|| INSTALLING The SpamAssassin Module 0.1 ||
============================================

This document contains instructions for installing the SpamAssassin Module
web-based todo list application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of the SpamAssassin Module, see
the file README in the top-level directory of the SpamAssassin Module
distribution.

OBTAINING The SpamAssassin Module
----------------------------------
(Not yet official)

The SpamAssassin Module can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/sam/
   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/sam/

Bleeding-edge development versions of the SpamAssassin Module are available via
CVS; see the file docs/HACKING in the Horde distribution for information on
accessing the Horde CVS repository.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

To function properly, the SpamAssassin Module **requires** the following:

  1. A working Horde installation.

     The SpamAssassin Module runs within the Horde Application Framework, a set
     of common tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must install Horde
     before installing the SpamAssassin Module.

     The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and
     FTP server, at

        http://www.horde.org/horde/
        ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

     Many of the SpamAssassin Module's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.
     Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the INSTALL
     file for the Horde Framework before installing the SpamAssassin Module.

  2. SQL support in PHP.

     The SpamAssassin Module store its data in an SQL database. Build PHP with
     whichever SQL driver you require; see the Horde INSTALL file for details.
     Currently the Spam Assassin Module supports PostgreSQL based tables, but
     should plug into MySQL with the proper DSN.

  3. SpamAssassin.

     The SpamAssassin Module was designed to help simplify the user level
     configuration of SpamAssassin. SpamAssassin itself must be installed and
     configured to use the SQL based configuration options that are available
     for SpamAssassin.

     SpamAssassin can be obtained from http://spamassassin.org/.

INSTALLING The SpamAssassin Module
-----------------------------------

The SpamAssassin Module is written in PHP, and must be installed in a
web-accessible directory. The precise location of this directory will differ
from system to system. Conventionally, the SpamAssassin Module is installed
directly underneath Horde in the webserver's document tree.

Since the SpamAssassin Module is written in PHP, there is no compilation
necessary; simply expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename
the root directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear
in the URL. For example, with the Apache webserver's default document
root of '/usr/local/apache/htdocs', you would type:

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/sam-0.0.1.tar.gz
   mv sam-0.0.1 sam

and would then find the SpamAssassin Module at the URL

   http://your-server/horde/sam/

CONFIGURING The SpamAssassin Module
------------------------------------

1. Configuring Horde for the SpamAssassin Module

   a. Register the application

      In horde/config/registry.php, find the applications['sam'] stanza.
      The 'show' parameter should already be marked '=> true'.
      If you have changed the location of the SpamAssassin Module relative to
      Horde, either in the URL or in the filesystem or both, you must
      update the 'fileroot' and 'webroot' settings to their correct
      values.

2. Creating the database table

   The specific steps to create the SpamAssassin Module database table depend
   on which database you've chosen to use.

   First, look in scripts/drivers/ to see if a script already
   exists for your database type. If so, you should be
   able to simply execute that script as superuser in your
   database. (Note that executing the script as the "horde" user will
   probably fail when granting privileges.)

   If such a script does not exist, you'll need to build your own, using
   the file sam_*.sql as a starting point. If you need
   assistance in creating databases, you may wish to let us know on
   the SpamAssassin Module mailing list.

3. Configuring The SpamAssassin Module.

   To configure the SpamAssassin Module, change to the config/ directory of the
   installed distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration
   "dist" files without the "dist" suffix:

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Documentation on the format of those files can be found in each file.

   You must at least configure the SpamAssassin Module in conf.php.

   The other files in config/ need only be modified if you wish
   to customize the SpamAssassin Module's appearance or behavior, as the
   defaults will be correct for most sites.

   Note for international users:  The SpamAssassin Module uses GNU gettext to
   provide local translations of text displayed by applications; the
   translations are found in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet
   available for your locale (and you wish to create one), or if you're having
   trouble using a provided translation, please see the horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS
   file for instructions.

4. Testing The SpamAssassin Module

   Use The SpamAssassin Module to change the default user configuration of
   SpamAssassin. Test at least the following:

     - Add a new Required Hits value.
     - Modify an existing Required Hits setting.
