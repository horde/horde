|| INSTALLING Jonah ||
======================

This document contains instructions for installing the Jonah software
on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Jonah, see
the file README in the top-level directory of the distribution.


Obtaining Jonah
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jonah can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/jonah/
   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/jonah/

Bleeding-edge development versions of Jonah are available via CVS; see
the file docs/HACKING in the Horde distribution for information on
accessing the Horde CVS repository.


PREREQUISITES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To function properly, Jonah REQUIRES the following:

  1. A working Horde installation.

     Jonah runs within the Horde Application Framework, a set of
     common tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must
     install Horde before installing Jonah.

     The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and
     FTP server, at

        http://www.horde.org/horde/
        ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

     Many of Jonah's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.
     Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the INSTALL
     file for the Horde Framework before installing Jonah.

  2. The following PHP capabilities:

     For the released tarball versions, you will require
     a working php 3 or 4 install with working XML support
     and fopen-wrappers enabled.

     For the CVS version, you will require a working php version
     4.2.0 or better, with XML and fopen-wrappers enabled.


Installing Jonah
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jonah is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from
system to system. Conventionally, Jonah is installed directly underneath
Horde in the web server's document tree.

Since Jonah is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary;
simply expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename
the root directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear
in the URL. For example, with the Apache web server's default document
root of '/usr/local/apache/htdocs', you would type:

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/jonah-0.0.2.tar.gz
   mv jonah-0.0.2 jonah

and would then find Jonah at the URL

   http://your-server/horde/jonah/

At this point, you should probably point your browser at your Jonah's test
page at http://your.server/horde/jonah/test.php. It will run some checks
on the version of php you're running, whether or not you have XML support,
miscellaneous php settings, and whether or not the config files are in the
right places.

Unless you've skipped ahead, it'll complain about not finding the config
files.  If no other problems are reported, continue on to the next section
on configuring Jonah.  If it finds other problems on the test page, you
should correct them first before proceeding.


CONFIGURING Jonah
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Configuring Horde for Jonah

   a. Register the application

      You will first need to add a jonah stanza to your version of the
      horde/config/registry.php file.  Edit this file, and add the
      following stanza where appropriate (after the other entries like it
      or between existing stanzas to position it in the menu where you
      like):

$this->applications['jonah'] = array(
    'fileroot' => dirname(__FILE__) . '/../jonah',
    'webroot' => $this->applications['horde']['webroot'] . '/jonah',
    'icon' => $this->applications['horde']['webroot'] . '/jonah/graphics/jonah.png',
    'name' => _("Jonah"),
    'status' => 'active'
);

      If you have changed the location of Jonah relative to Horde,
      either in the URL or in the file system or both, you must
      update the 'fileroot' and/or 'webroot' settings to their correct
      values.

2. Configuring Jonah

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the configuration files in the
   ``config/`` directory can be found in each file.  You may edit these files
   if you wish to customize Jonah's appearance and behavior.  The defaults
   will be correct for most sites.

   You must then login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Jonah.  Use the Horde "Administration" menu item to get
   the the Administration page, and then on the click on the "Configuration"
   icon to get the Configuration page.  Select "Headlines" from the selection
   list of applications, and click on the "Configure" button.  Fill in or
   change any configuration values as needed.  When done click on "Generate
   Headlines Configuration" to generate the conf.php file.  If your web server
   doesn't have write permissions to the Jonah configuration directory or
   file, it will not be able to write the file.  In this case, cut and
   paste the returned configuration information into the file
   jonah/config/conf.php.

   Note for international users:  Jonah uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are
   found in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available
   for your locale (and you wish to create one), or if you're having
   trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS file for instructions.

    (a). prefs.php

        This file contains all the preferences and their default values.
        Reasons you might edit this are to change default values or to
        lock preferences so the user can't change them.

    (b). templates.php

        This file defines the formatting templates used to display the
        channels for various layout styles.  You will probably not want
        to modify this file.

    (c). conf.php or conf.xml
        This file contains the general configuration for Jonah, such as
        sql settings, expiration settings, etc.

        For CVS HEAD, You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to
        finish the configuration of Jonah.  Use the Horde "Administration"
        menu item to get to the Administration page, and then click on the
        "Configuration" icon to get the Configuration page.  Select Jonah
        from the selection list of applications, and click on the
        "Configure" button.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
        needed.  When done click on "Generate Jonah Configuration" to
        generate the conf.php file.  If your web server doesn't have write
        permissions to the jonah configuration directory or file, it will
        not be able to write the file.  In this case, cut and paste the
        returned configuration information in the file jonah/config/conf.php.
