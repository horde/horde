The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first alpha release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H5 (3.0.0).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both server-side
(Sieve, Procmail, Maildrop) and client-side (IMAP) message filtering. For more
information on Ingo, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/ingo.

The major changes compared to the Ingo version H4 are:
    * Completely redesigned user interface.
    * Added placeholder variables to vacation messages.
    * Small improvements.
