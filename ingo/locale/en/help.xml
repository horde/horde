    <title>Blacklist: Action</title>
    <para>This action defines what to do when a message from a blocked sender
    is sent to you. The possible values are "delete" or "move to folder". If
    "delete" is selected, the messages will be discarded before ever being
    stored in your Inbox. If "move to folder" is selected, they will be
    delivered to the selected folder.</para>

    <title>Rules: Filter Rules</title>
    <para>This is the main rules screen. From here you can create new rules by

    the up and down arrows or entering new rule positions in the "Move" column;
    enable and disable specific rules by clicking on the icon in the "Enabled"
    column; and edit individual rules by clicking on the icon in the "Edit"
    column or on the rule name.</para>

      <tip>Please note, that the rules are executed in the order displayed

  <entry id="pref-show_filter_msg">
    <title>Preference: Show detailed filter status messages?</title>
    <para>If using the IMAP filtering driver, this preference controls how
    verbose the filtering process is. If set to yes, every message filtered
    will result in a separate notification message output to the screen
    immediately after the message is processed. If set to no, only a summary of
    filter actions will be output to the screen.</para>
  </entry>
  <entry id="pref-filter_seen">
    <title>Preference: Filter only [un]seen messages?</title>
    <para>This preference identifies when the IMAP filtering driver will
    attempt to apply rules to the INBOX. You can either apply filters to all
    messages, apply filters ONLY to messages that are marked unseen, or apply
    filters ONLY to message that have been marked seen.</para>
  </entry>
  <entry id="rule">
    <title>Filter Rule</title>
    <para>A rule is the basic building block of your mail filters, it consists
    of one or more conditions and one or more actions. When a message is sent
    to you, it is processed through the conditions of your filter rules, if the
    conditions that you specify are met, then the actions that you specify will
    be performed on that message. Filters can be very useful for automatically
    deleting unwanted mail, or making your mail account more managable by
    storing related messages into different folders.</para>
  </entry>
  <entry id="rule-action">
    <title>Filter Rule: Action</title>
    <para>These are the possible actions to take if an incoming message matches
    the specified conditions. Note that all of these options may not be
    available to you - only the options that work with the underlying filtering
    software will be shown.</para>
    <heading>Deliver this message into my INBOX</heading>
    <para>The message will be saved in your INBOX. This is the default
    option.</para>
    <heading>Deliver to this mailbox</heading>
    <para>The message will be delivered to the specified folder.</para>
    <heading>Discard this message</heading>
    <para>The message will be silently deleted. Neither you nor the sender will
    receive notification that this has happened.</para>
    <heading>Redirect this message to</heading>
    <para>The message will be sent to the email address that you specify. No
    copy of the message will remain in this account.</para>
    <heading>Deliver to my INBOX and redirect to</heading>
    <para>The message will be sent to the email address that you specify, and a
    copy of the message will remain in your INBOX.</para>
    <heading>Reject this message with reason</heading>
    <para>The original message will be discarded, and a new message will be
    sent to the sender with the text that you specify.</para>
  </entry>
  <entry id="rule-combine">
    <title>Filter Rule: Combine Options</title>
    <para>You may define multiple conditions within a single rule. You may
    group them together logically using "and"/"or". You may not create complex
    filters containg both types of conditions.</para>
    <heading>And</heading>
    <para>If you select AND, an incoming message must match every condition
    that you specify in order for the actions to be executed.</para>
    <heading>Or</heading>
    <para>If you select OR, the specified actions will be executed if at least
    one of the conditions is met.</para>
  </entry>
  <entry id="rule-mark">
    <title>Filter Rule: Mark Message</title>
    <para>You may specify marking a message with one or more IMAP flags as one
    of the actions in a rule. The possible values are Seen, Flagged For Followup,
    Answered, and Deleted.</para>
  </entry>
  <entry id="rule-matches">
    <title>Filter Rule: Matches</title>
    <para>There are 3 components to each condition in a rule. The first is the
    field to examine. The second is the type of comparison to perform. The
    third is the value to which the field should be compared. There are a few
    different types of comparisons that can be performed. The comparisons
    available for any given field will depend on both the type of the field and
    what the underlying filtering software can handle. Thus, all potential
    matching options listed below may not appear for a given field.</para>
    <heading>Contains</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified string is found
    anywhere on the line. Example: user@example would match
    joe_user@example.com</para>
    <heading>Doesn't Contain</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified string is not found
    anywhere on the line. Example: user@example would not match
    joe_user@example.com</para>
    <heading>Is</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified string matches the
    line exactly. Example: user@example.com is user@example.com</para>
    <heading>Isn't</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified string does not match
    the line exactly. Example: user@example is not user@example.com</para>
    <heading>Begins with</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified string matches the
    beginning of the line. Example: user@example will match
    user@example.com</para>
    <heading>Doesn't begin with</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified string does not match
    the beginning of the line. Example: user@example.com will not match
    user@example</para>
    <heading>Ends with</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified string matches the end
    of the line. Example: example.com will match user@example.com</para>
    <heading>Doesn't end with</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified string does not match
    the end of the line. Example: horde.org will not match
    user@example.com</para>
    <heading>Exists</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified header exists in the
    message, regardless of what its value is.</para>
    <heading>Doesn't Exist</heading>
    <para>Will be considered to be true if the specified header does not exist
    in the message.</para>
    <heading>Regex</heading>
    <para>Regex allows you to use complex POSIX compatible regular expressions
    to compare against message headers. Example: "Received from [*\.*\.*\.*] by
    (hosta|hostb).example.com*" would match "Received from [172.16.100.1] by
    hosta.example.com on Tuesday"</para>
    <heading>Matches</heading>
    <para>Matches is similar to contains, with the exception that you may use *
    and ? as wildcards. An * will match any number of characters, and a ? will
    match exactly one charater. Example: "*user?@example.com" will match both
    "user1@example.com" and "otheruser2@example.com"</para>
    <heading>Doesn't match</heading>
    <para>Doesn't match is the same as matches except that it will evaluate to
    false if the specified value matches the string in the message
    header.</para>
    <heading>Less than</heading>
    <para>This is a relational test which will compare the value you specify
    and the value in the message header numerically.</para>
    <heading>Less than or equal to</heading>
    <para>This is a relational test which will compare the value you specify
    and the value in the message header numerically.</para>
    <heading>Equal to</heading>
    <para>This is a relational test which will compare the value you specify
    and the value in the message header numerically.</para>
    <heading>Greater than or equal to</heading>

    and the value in the message header numerically.</para>
    <heading>Greater than</heading>
    <para>This is a relational test which will compare the value you specify
    and the value in the message header numerically.</para>
    <heading>Limitation with Sieve filtering</heading>
    <warn>The Sieve specification doesn't support comparions with negative
    numbers. If you enter a negative value in one of the relational tests,
    your rule won't work correctly.</warn>
