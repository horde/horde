The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Horde
Groupware version 5.0.0.

suite. Users can manage and share calendars, contacts, tasks and notes with the
standards compliant components from the Horde Project.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome. Strings are not going
to change until the final release.

Please note that upgrading from a stable version to a beta version is currently
not possible due to a bug in the PEAR installer.
