Introduction
============

These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Horde Groupware versions.
Please backup your existing data before running any of the steps described
below, you need the backups in case anything goes wrong with the upgrade
process, which cannot be reverted automatically. You can't use the updated data
with your old Horde Groupware version anymore.

Please see below for changes between certain Horde Groupware versions that are
not covered by the update script.


Upgrading a Horde Groupware 4 or later
======================================

Upgrading Horde Groupware is as easy as running::

   pear upgrade -a -B horde/groupware

If you want to upgrade from a Horde Groupware version prior to 4.0, please
follow the instructions in INSTALL_ to install the most recent Horde Groupware
version using the PEAR installer.

After updating to a newer Horde Groupware version, you **always** need to
update configurations and database schemes. Log in as an administrator, go to
Administration => Configuration and update anything that's highlighted as
outdated.


Upgrading Horde Groupware from 4.0.x to 4.0.4
=============================================


Weather portal block
--------------------

The weather.com website has dropped their API to retrieve weather forecasts
with a very short notice. The weather.com portal block has been removed and
will be automatically removed from the users' portal configurations too.

A new portal block for weather forecasts is available, powered by the new
Horde_Service_Weather library that supports a number of free weather
services. To provide this block to the end users, install the
Horde_Service_Weather library from Horde's PEAR server, and configure a weather
service in Horde Groupware's configuration::

   pear install horde/horde_service_weather-alpha


Configuration changes
---------------------

The 'nobase64_img' option was added.


Upgrading a Horde Groupware 1.x
===============================

For upgrading from a Horde Groupware version 1.x to 4.0 or later, see the
section `Upgrading a Horde Groupware 4 or later`_.

The update script will automatically migrate database backends and
update configuration files. It will add new and changed configurations
at the end of existing configuration files, any changes done to old
configuration files won't get lost, but might get overridden by new
settings. You might want to check the updated configuration files
after the update script has finished to make sure that any
customizations that you did to the old version still work as expected.

The ``.dist`` versions of the configuration files alway contain the most
recent reference settings and the settings documentation. If you experience
any problems with the configuration files after an update, or if you want
cleaner configuration files without all the updating code, you can create
fresh versions from the ``.dist`` files.

These instructions are supposed to be used with a complete tarball of the new
Horde Groupware version. They don't work if you use a patch file to upgrade
your installation, because the patch already contains all configuration file
changes that the update script is going to add.

1. Extract the tarball of the new version **in parallel** to the old
   version. See the INSTALL_ file details how to unpack a tarball.

   If you want to replace the old version with the new version eventually, you
   should move the old version to a different place now and put the new
   version in the place of the old one. You can still do this later, if you
   want to, but you have to edit the configuration file then.

2. Start the setup script::

     ./scripts/setup.php

3. Choose the update option in the setup menu and answer the questions from
   the setup script.

4. Pray.

5. If everything went fine and without any error messages, point your browser
   to the URL of the new version and log in as an administrator. Go to the
   ``Administration -> Setup`` screen and update all configurations that are
   marked as being outdated.

6. If you want to replace the old version with the new one, and if you didn't
   do this already in step 1, you can do it now. But you have to edit the
   configuration file ``config/conf.php`` manually and change the setting
   ``$conf['cookie']['path']`` to match the new URL path. Otherwise you won't
   be able to login after you moved Horde Groupware to a different directory.


Upgrading Horde Groupware from 1.0.x to 1.1.x
=============================================


Memcache Configuration
----------------------

All memcache configuration has been moved to the $conf['memcache'] parameter.


Application Hooks
-----------------

All hooks that are specific to a single application have been moved to that
application's ``config/hooks.php`` file. Split up your existing Hooks from
``horde/config/hooks.php`` and move them to the correct application.


Group Hooks
-----------

The format for group hook functions has changed from
_group_hook_groupName($username) to _group_hook($groupName,
$userName).  So you will need to modify any existing group hook
functions in config/hooks.php for the new interface.

Alternatively, an example _group_hook() function is provided in
config/hooks.php that will call the old style hook functions for you.


Custom Themes
-------------

Themes no longer have ``info.php`` files. If you have any custom
themes that provide their own images, you must add a
``themed_graphics`` file to the theme's directory (for all
applications the theme provides images for) in order for Horde to know
to use the custom images. The file can be empty or contain whatever
you wish; it simply needs to exist.


Static Log out Links
--------------------

If you have hardcoded a log out link in any custom templates or menu
items, you must update it to use Horde::getServiceLink(). This is
because logging out is now protected by a token to avoid CSRF
exploits.


IMSP Driver and Share Support
-----------------------------

Share support has been added to the IMSP driver.  This support requires at
least a Horde 3.2 install.  With this change, any IMSP address books the user
has rights to will be represented internally as a Horde share.  Permissions
changed on the share will be reflected back to the IMSP server.  If you set
the configuration setting ``Name of source for creating new shares`` to
``imsp`` then any shares created by the user will result in a new IMSP address
book being created on the IMSP server.  Likewise, any IMSP address book
deleted in Turba will be removed from the IMSP server.

To enable this support, make sure you are using at least Horde 3.2, set the
``use_shares`` attribute to true, and uncomment the IMSP
``_horde_hook_share_*`` functions in ``horde/config/hooks.php``.

With this change, the ``IMSP Address Book Administration`` option page has
been removed, as the creation/deletion of address books is now handled with
shares.

.. Important:: IMSP contacts contained in contact groups that are not from an
               IMSP source may not be visible within that group when migrating
               an IMSP source to a share.
