Introduction
============

These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Horde Kolab Edition
versions.  Please backup your existing data before running any of the
steps described below, you need the backups in case anything goes
wrong with the upgrade process, which cannot be reverted
automatically. You can't use the updated data with your old Horde
Kolab Edition version anymore.

Please see below for changes between certain Horde Kolab versions that
are not covered by the update script.


Upgrading a Horde Kolab Edition 4 or later
==========================================

Upgrading Horde Kolab Edition is as easy as running::

   pear upgrade -a -B horde/kolab_webmail

After updating to a newer Horde Kolab Edition version, you **always**
need to update configurations and database schemes. Log in as an
administrator, go to Administration => Configuration and update
anything that's highlighted as outdated.
