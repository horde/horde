The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Horde
Groupware Webmail Edition version 5.0.0.

Horde Groupware Webmail Edition is a free, enterprise ready, browser based
communication suite. Users can read, send and organize email messages with
four different webmail interfaces and manage and share calendars, contacts,
tasks and notes with the standards compliant components from the Horde
Project.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome. Strings are not going
to change until the final release.

For upgrading instructions, please see

Please note that upgrading from a stable version to a beta version is currently
not possible due to a bug in the PEAR installer.
