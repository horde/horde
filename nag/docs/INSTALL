This document contains instructions for installing the Nag web-based todo list
application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Nag, see the file README_
in the top-level directory of the Nag distribution.


Obtaining Nag
=============

Nag can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/nag/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/nag/

Bleeding-edge development versions of Nag are available via CVS; see the file
`docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution for information on accessing the
Horde CVS repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Nag requires the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Nag runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Nag.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Nag's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.  Be sure to have
   completed all of the steps in the INSTALL_ file for the Horde Framework
   before installing Nag.

2. SQL support in PHP *or* a configured Kolab Server.

   Nag will store its data in either an SQL database or on a Kolab Server.
   If you use SQL, build PHP with whichever SQL driver you require; see the
   Horde INSTALL_ file for details.


Installing Nag
==============

Nag is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, Nag is installed directly underneath Horde in the webserver's
document tree.

Since Nag is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply expand
the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root directory of
the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For example, with
the Apache webserver's default document root of ``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``,
you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/nag-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv nag-x.y.z nag

and would then find Nag at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/nag/


Configuring Nag
===============

1. Configuring Horde for Nag

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['nag']``
      stanza.  The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired.  If you have changed the location of Nag relative to
      Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update the
      ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

   b. Configuring a Share backend

      Nag requires a permanent ``Shares`` backend in Horde to manage
      tasklists and to add tasks to tasklists.  If you didn't setup a Share
      backend yet, go to the configuration interface, select Horde from the
      list of applications and select the ``Shares`` tab. Unless you are using
      Kolab, you should select ``SQL``. Make sure that you ran the necessary
      scripts to create a storage backend for the Share system, e.g. one of the
      ``create.*.sql``.

2. Creating the database table

   The specific steps to create the Nag database table depend on which
   database you've chosen to use.  If you've chosen to use the Kolab driver,
   skip this step.

   First, look in ``scripts/sql/`` to see if a script already exists
   for your database type.  If so, you should be able to simply execute that
   script as superuser in your database.  (Note that executing the script as
   the "horde" user will probably fail when granting privileges.)

   If such a script does not exist, you'll need to build your own, using the
   file nag.sql as a starting point.  If you need assistance in creating
   databases, you may wish to let us know on the Nag mailing list.

3. Configuring Nag

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the configuration files in the
   ``config/`` directory can be found in each file.  You may edit these files
   if you wish to customize Nag's appearance and behavior.  The defaults
   will be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Nag.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get to
   the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``Tasks`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Tasks Configuration`` to generate the ``conf.php``
   file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to the Nag
   configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the file.  In
   this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the other methods
   to create the configuration file ``nag/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Nag uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

4. Testing Nag

   Use Nag to create, modify, and delete todos. Test at least the following:

   - Creating a new todo item
   - Modifying a todo item
   - Completing a todo item
   - Deleting a todo item
