 Upgrading Nag
===============

:Contact: nag@lists.horde.org


These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Nag versions. Please backup
your existing data before running any of the steps described below. You can't
use the updated data with your old Nag version anymore.


Upgrading Nag from 2.2.x to 2.3.x
=================================

Some fields in the SQL share driver tables have been changed. Execute the
provided SQL script to update your database if you are using the native SQL
share driver.

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password>  <db name> < scripts/upgrades/2.2_to_2.3.sql


Upgrading Nag from 2.1.x to 2.2.x
=================================


SQL Backends
------------

A few new fields have been added to the default SQL table layout.

Execute the provided SQL script to update your data to the new Nag version,
e.g.::

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password> <db name> < scripts/upgrades/2.1_to_2.2.sql

You also have to execute the provided PHP script::

   php scripts/upgrades/2006-04-18_add_creator_and_assignee_fields.php


New Beta SQL Share Driver Support
---------------------------------

A new beta-level SQL Horde_Share driver has been added in Horde 3.2. This driver
offers significant performance improvements over the existing Datatree driver,
but it has not received the same level of testing, thus the beta designation.
In order to make use of this driver, you must be using Horde 3.2-RC3 or
later. The new tables needed for this driver already should have been created
by the step above.

If you want to use the new SQL Share driver, you must also execute the
provided PHP script to migrate your existing share data to the new format::

   php scripts/upgrades/convert_datatree_shares_to_sql.php
