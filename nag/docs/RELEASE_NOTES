The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Nag Task
List Manager version H5 (4.2.0).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes CalDAV support, strong integration with the other
Horde applications, and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight
project management.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

For upgrading instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/nag/docs/UPGRADING

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/nag/docs/INSTALL

The major changes compared to the Nag version H5 (4.2.0alpha1) are:
    * Don't require URL rewriting.
    * Small bugfixes.
