The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Nag Task List
Manager version H5 (4.0.0).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight project management.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H4 are:
    * Completely redesigned user interface.
    * Added recurring tasks.
    * Added smart task lists.
    * Added login task to purge completed tasks.
    * Converted categories to tags.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
