The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Nag Task List
Manager version H4 (3.0.8).

provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight project management.

    * Updated Hungarian, Italian, and Swedish translations.
