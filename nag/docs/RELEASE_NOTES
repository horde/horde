The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Nag Task List
Manager version H4 (3.0.5).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight project management.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H4 (3.0.4) are:
    * Improved date and time fields.
    * Added option to choose which tasklists to synchronize.
    * Small bugfixes.
