/**
 * This file defines reminders sent automatically by Whups (if you schedule the
 * whups-reminders script in your crontab).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
 * Local overrides MUST be placed in reminders.local.php or reminders.d/.
 * If the 'vhosts' setting has been enabled in Horde's configuration, you can
 * use reminders-servername.php.
 *
 * Hopefully rule definition will migrate to a database in the future,
 * for easy configuration through the web interface.
 *
 * You can add as many reminder rules as you like. Each one is defined
 * by an array with the following indices:
 *
 *   'frequency' => A cron-style date specification defining how often
 *                  the rule will be triggered. For example,
 *                  '* 30 11 1-31&Mon *' would run any second, at half
 *                  past the hour of 11, every Monday in the month, every
 *                  month.
 *
 *   'server_name' => The hostname that reminder emails will be sent
 *                    from. Necessary since $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] is
 *                    not present when running from cron. You can ignore
 *                    this if you've set an explicit server name in
 *                    horde's conf.php in $conf['server']['name'].
 *
 *   'queue' => Which Whups queue are we looking at?
 *
 *   'unassigned' => What email address should we send notification of
 *                   unassigned tickets to? Can be set to false or any
 *                   empty value if no email is necessary.
 *
 *   'category' => An array of states to send reminders for. Any of
 *                 'unconfirmed', 'new', 'assigned', and 'resolved',
 *                 though I doubt you'll want to send reminders for
 *                 resolved tickets.
