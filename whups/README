Whups is a Horde ticket-tracking application. It is very flexible in design,
and can be used for help-desk requests, tracking sofware development, and
anything else that needs to track a set of requests and their status.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.

Terminology
-----------

Queues
  Project name (or other major category name). This is the top level
  structure.

Types
  Project Type, each Type has the following components:

  States
    State (Stage) of the current item. For example: new, open, closed,
    resolved, etc.

  Priorities
    Priority of the current item. For example: Critical, High, Low, Normal,
    Urgent, etc. Could also be abstracted (Red, Yellow, Green; 1, 2, 3; etc)

  Attributes
    From a large set of attribute types, an arbitrary number of attributes can
    be added, including attribute names, descriptions, whether they are
    required etc.

  Form Replies
    Reply texts for updating tickets, used for automatically filling ticket
    comments with stock phrases.

Responsible Users
  Users responsible for a queue. These can be anyone, but should be Horde
  users. Notifications only work with Horde users who have identities with an
  email address set.

Versions
  Allows you to track multiple versions of the same project. Can be used for
  actual versions (CVS HEAD, 1.0, etc), development cycles (planning,
  prototyping, production), etc.

Tickets
  This is an "Instance" of a Type.
