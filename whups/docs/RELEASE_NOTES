The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Whups Ticket
Tracking System version H4 (2.0.1).

Whups is a Horde ticket-tracking application. It is very flexible in design,
and can be used for help-desk requests, tracking software development, and
anything else that needs to track a set of requests and their status.

The major changes compared to the Whups version H4 (2.0) are:
    * Improved ticket generation from e-mail messages.
    * Fixed creating restricted comments.
    * Fixed CLI scripts.
    * Added Latvian translation.
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.
