The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Whups Ticket
Tracking System version H4 (2.0).

Whups is a Horde ticket-tracking application. It is very flexible in design,
and can be used for help-desk requests, tracking software development, and
anything else that needs to track a set of requests and their status.

Major changes compared to the Whups H3 versions are:
    * Updated to work with Horde 4.
    * Improved mail filter for converting email messages to tickets.
    * More flexible and extended notification messages.
    * Support complex attributes types.
    * Allow to create private comments during ticket creation.
    * Added script to convert backends to UTF-8.
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.
