General instructions
====================

These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Whups versions. Please backup
your existing data before running any of the steps described below. You can't
use the updated data with your old Whups version anymore.

Upgrading Whups is as easy as running::

   pear upgrade -a -B horde/whups

If you want to upgrade from a Whups version prior to 2.0, please
follow the instructions in INSTALL_ to install the most recent Whups
version using the PEAR installer.

After updating to a newer Whups version, you **always** need to update
configurations and database schemes. Log in as an administrator, go to
Administration => Configuration and update anything that's highlighted as
outdated.


Upgrading Whups from 1.0.x to 2.0.x
===================================

All command line scripts have been renamed, the new versions all have whups-
prefixes.
- Email template changes.


Upgrading Whups from 1.0 to 1.0.1
=================================

SQL Backends

default SQL table layout.

e.g.::
