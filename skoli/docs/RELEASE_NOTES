The Horde Team is pleased to announce the [first release candidate|final
release] of the Skoli Foo Bar Application version H3 (x.x).

Skoli is a simple administrative module for teachers. Several contacts 
(students) will be summarized to a class. To each student one can then 
enter marks, objectives, outcomes and absences. Besides offering a search 
function Skoli also offers an export option in the CSV and TSV formats.

[For alpha/beta releases:
This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.]

[For release candidates:
Barring any problems, this code will be released as Skoli H3 (x.x).
Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.]

The major changes compared to the Skoli version H3 (x.x) are:
