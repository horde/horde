The Horde Team is pleased to announce the second release candidate of the Gollem
File Manager version H4 (2.0-RC2).

Gollem is a web-based file manager, providing the ability to fully manage a
hierarchical file system stored in a variety of backends such as a SQL
database, as part of a real filesystem, or on FTP, Samba or SSH servers.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Gollem H4 (2.0).
Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The major changes compared to Gollem version H4 (2.0-RC1) are:
    * Small bugfixes and improvements.
