General instructions
====================

These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Gollem versions. Please backup
your existing data before running any of the steps described below. You can't
use the updated data with your old Gollem version anymore.

Upgrading Gollem is as easy as running::

   pear upgrade -a -B horde/gollem

If you want to upgrade from an Gollem version prior to 2.0, please follow
the instructions in INSTALL_ to install the most recent Gollem version
using the PEAR installer.

After updating to a newer Gollem version, you **always** need to update
configurations and database schemes. Log in as an administrator, go to
Administration => Configuration and update anything that's highlighted as
outdated.



Upgrading Gollem From 1.x To 2.x
================================

This is a non-exhaustive, quick explanation of what has changed between a
Gollem 1.x installation to Gollem 2.x.


MIME Viewer Options (mime_drivers.php)
--------------------------------------

Gollem specific MIME configuration is no longer needed, so this configuration
file can be removed.


Server Options (backends.php)
-----------------------------

The 'clipboard' option has been removed.  The availability of the clipboard
is now entirely dependent on the user's edit permissions for the application.
