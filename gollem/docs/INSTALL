This document contains instructions for installing the Gollem File Manager on
your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Gollem, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Gollem distribution.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Gollem **REQUIRES** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Gollem runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Gollem.

   .. Important:: Gollem 2.0 requires version 4.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Gollem. Many of Gollem's prerequisites are also
                  Horde prerequisites. Additionally, many of Gollem's optional
                  features are configured via the Horde install.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/


2. The following PHP capabilities:

   a. FTP support (--with-ftp) [OPTIONAL]

      If using the FTP VFS driver, the FTP PHP module is **required**.

   b. SQL support [OPTIONAL]

      If using an SQL VFS driver, then SQL PHP support is **required**. For
      further information on how to set up SQL support in Horde, please
      reference the Horde installation document (`horde/docs/INSTALL`_).

3. If using a FTP backend, you **must** have at least one FTP server.
   If using a SQL backend, you **must** have at least one SQL server.

4. If the ability to browse files using WebDAV is desired, the
   HTTP_WebDAV_Server PEAR module is required.

   To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

       pear install HTTP_WebDAV_Server


Installing Gollem
=================

There are several ways to install Gollem. The recommended way to install Gollem
is using the PEAR installer. Alternatively it can be installed from
tarballs. Finally, if you want to run the latest development code, or get the
latest, not yet released, fixes, you can install Gollem from Git.


Installing with PEAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First follow the instructions in `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ to prepare a PEAR
environment for Horde and install the Horde Framework.

When installing Gollem through PEAR now, the installer will automatically
install any dependencies of Gollem too. By default, only the required
dependencies will be installed::

   pear install horde/gollem

If you want to install Gollem even with all optional dependencies, you need to
specify the ``-a`` flag. Please note that this might also try to install PHP
extensions through PECL that might need further configuration or activation in
your PHP configuration::

   pear install -a horde/gollem

If you want to install Gollem with all optional dependencies, but without the
binary PECL packages that need to be compiled, specify both the ``-a`` and the
``-B`` flag::

   pear install -a -B horde/gollem


Installing from Release Tarballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Important:: As of today, there are no tarballs released for Gollem 2
               yet. Please use the `Installing with PEAR`_ method to install
               Gollem 2.

Gollem can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/gollem/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/gollem/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Gollem is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, Gollem is installed directly underneath Horde in the web
server's document tree.

Since Gollem is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/gollem-1.0.tar.gz
   mv gollem-1.0 gollem

and would then find Gollem at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/gollem/


Configuring Gollem
==================

1. Configuring Gollem

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Gollem.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``File Manager`` from the selection
   list of applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
   needed.  When done click on ``Generate File Manager Configuration`` to
   generate Gollem configuration directory or file, it will not be able to
   write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one
   of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``gollem/config/conf.php``.

   To configure Gollem, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and copy the ``backends.php.dist`` configuration file to
   ``backends.php`` and edit it to your needs. You must be sure to configure an
   appropriate backend in ``backends.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the other configuration files in
   the ``config/`` directory can be found in each file. You may create
   ``*.local.php`` versions of these files if you wish to customize Gollem's
   appearance and behavior. See the header of the configuration files for
   details and examples. The defaults will be correct for most sites.
