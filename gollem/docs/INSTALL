This document contains instructions for installing the Gollem File Manager on
your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Gollem, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Gollem distribution.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Gollem **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Gollem runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Gollem.

   .. Important:: Gollem 3.0 requires version 5.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Gollem. Many of Gollem's prerequisites are also
                  Horde prerequisites. Additionally, many of Gollem's optional
                  features are configured via the Horde install.

2. The following PHP capabilities:

   a. FTP support (--with-ftp) [OPTIONAL]

      If using the FTP VFS driver, the FTP PHP module is **required**.

   b. SQL support [OPTIONAL]

      If using an SQL VFS driver, then SQL PHP support is **required**. For
      further information on how to set up SQL support in Horde, please
      reference the Horde installation document (`horde/docs/INSTALL`_).

3. If using a FTP backend, you **must** have at least one FTP server.
   If using a SQL backend, you **must** have at least one SQL server.

4. If the ability to browse files using WebDAV is desired, the
   HTTP_WebDAV_Server PEAR module is required.

   To install, enter the following at the command prompt::

       pear install HTTP_WebDAV_Server


Installing Gollem
=================

The **RECOMMENDED** way to install Gollem is using the PEAR installer.
Alternatively, if you want to run the latest development code or get the
latest not yet released fixes, you can install Gollem from Git.

Installing with PEAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First follow the instructions in `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ to prepare a PEAR
environment for Horde and install the Horde Framework.

When installing Gollem through PEAR now, the installer will automatically
install any dependencies of Gollem too. If you want to install Gollem with all
optional dependencies, but without the binary PECL packages that need to be
compiled, specify both the ``-a`` and the ``-B`` flag::

   pear install -a -B horde/gollem

By default, only the required dependencies will be installed::

   pear install horde/gollem

If you want to install Gollem even with all binary dependencies, you need to
remove the ``-B`` flag. Please note that this might also try to install PHP
extensions through PECL that might need further configuration or activation in
your PHP configuration::

   pear install -a horde/gollem

Installing from Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See http://www.horde.org/source/git.php


Configuring Gollem
==================

1. Configuring Gollem

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Gollem.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``File Manager`` from the selection
   list of applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
   needed.  When done click on ``Generate File Manager Configuration`` to
   generate Gollem configuration directory or file, it will not be able to
   write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one
   of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``gollem/config/conf.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the other configuration files in
   the ``config/`` directory can be found in each file. You may create
   ``*.local.php`` versions of these files if you wish to customize Gollem's
   appearance and behavior. See the header of the configuration files for
   details and examples. The defaults will be correct for most sites.
