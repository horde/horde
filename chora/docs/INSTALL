This document contains instructions for installing the Chora Repository Viewer
on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Chora, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Chora distribution.


Obtaining Chora
===============

Chora can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/chora/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/chora/

Bleeding-edge development versions of Chora are available via CVS; see the
file `docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution for information on accessing
the Horde CVS repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Chora requires the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Chora runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Chora.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Chora's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.  Be sure to
   have completed all of the steps in the INSTALL_ file for the Horde
   Framework before installing Chora.

2. A VCS repository to view.

   Chora can display any number of local and remote repositories. If accessing
   a local repository, the user under which the web server is running needs
   read access to the repositories.

   TODO: Documentation on the various drivers

3. VCS binaries.

   Depending on which kind of repositories you want to use, you need SVN
   (http://subversion.tigris.org/), RCS/CVS (http://www.cvshome.org/), or
   Git (http://git-scm.com/) binaries.


Installing Chora
================

Chora is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, Chora is installed directly underneath Horde in the
webserver's document tree.

Since Chora is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For
example, with the Apache webserver's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/chora-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv chora-x.y.z chora

and would then find Chora at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/chora/


Configuring Chora
=================

1. Configuring Horde for Chora

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['chora']``
      stanza.  The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired.  If you have changed the location of Chora relative to
      Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update the
      ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

2. Configuring Chora

   To configure Chora, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Documentation on the format of those files can be found in each file.  With
   the exception of the ``conf.*`` (see below) and ``backends.php`` files,
   the other files in ``config/`` need only be modified if you wish to
   customize Chora's appearance or behavior, as the defaults will be correct
   for most sites.

   You must be sure to list your repository names and configuration
   information in ``backends.php``.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Chora.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``Version Control`` from the selection
   list of applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
   needed.  When done click on ``Generate Version Control Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Chora configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``chora/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Chora uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

3. Testing Chora

   Go to the Chora URL, and test out all the functionality to ensure it is
   working.

   If you run into a problem with annotationsin CVS repositories, it is
   because some versions of CVS insist on having the ``CVSROOT/history`` file
   as world-writable.  Either make this file world-writable, or simply delete
   it (you don't need to have it for CVS to work).
