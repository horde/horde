These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Mnemo versions. Please

===================================

The group_uid field in the SQL share driver groups table has been changed from
an INT to a VARCHAR(255). Execute the provided SQL script to update your
database if you are using the native SQL share driver.

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password>  <db name> < scripts/upgrades/2.2.1_to_2.2.2.sql

Upgrading Mnemo from 2.x to 2.2
===============================


New Beta SQL Share Driver Support
---------------------------------

A new beta-level SQL Horde_Share driver has been added in Horde 3.2. This driver
offers significant performance improvements over the existing Datatree driver,
but it has not received the same level of testing, thus the beta designation.
In order to make use of this driver, you must be using Horde 3.2-RC3 or
later. To create the new tables needed for this driver, execute the provided SQL
script::

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password> <db name> < scripts/upgrades/2.1_to_2.2.sql

If you want to use the new SQL Share driver, you must also execute the
provided PHP script to migrate your existing share data to the new format::

   php scripts/upgrades/convert_datatree_shares_to_sql.php


Upgrading Mnemo from 1.1.x to 2.0
=================================


SQL Backends
============

Execute the provided SQL script to update your data to the new Mnemo version::

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password> <db name> < scripts/upgrades/1.1_to_2.0.mysql.sql


Categories
==========

Categories are now being maintained centrally for all Horde applications that
support them.  To convert the old memo categories execute the provided PHP
script::

   php scripts/upgrades/2004-05-19_convert_categories_to_strings.php
