General instructions
====================

These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Mnemo versions. Please backup
your existing data before running any of the steps described below. You can't
use the updated data with your old Mnemo version anymore.

Upgrading Mnemo is as easy as running::

   pear upgrade -a -B horde/mnemo

If you want to upgrade from a Mnemo version prior to 3.0, please
follow the instructions in INSTALL_ to install the most recent Mnemo
version using the PEAR installer.

After updating to a newer Mnemo version, you **always** need to update
configurations and database schemes. Log in as an administrator, go to
Administration => Configuration and update anything that's highlighted as
outdated.


Upgrading Mnemo from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2
===================================

The group_uid field in the SQL share driver groups table has been changed from
an INT to a VARCHAR(255). Execute the provided SQL script to update your
database if you are using the native SQL share driver.

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password>  <db name> < scripts/upgrades/2.2.1_to_2.2.2.sql

Upgrading Mnemo from 2.x to 2.2
===============================


New Beta SQL Share Driver Support
---------------------------------

A new beta-level SQL Horde_Share driver has been added in Horde 3.2. This driver
offers significant performance improvements over the existing Datatree driver,
but it has not received the same level of testing, thus the beta designation.
In order to make use of this driver, you must be using Horde 3.2-RC3 or
later. To create the new tables needed for this driver, execute the provided SQL
script::

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password> <db name> < scripts/upgrades/2.1_to_2.2.sql

If you want to use the new SQL Share driver, you must also execute the
provided PHP script to migrate your existing share data to the new format::

   mnemo-convert-datatree-shares-to-sql
