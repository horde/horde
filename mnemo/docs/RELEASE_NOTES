The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Mnemo Note
Manager version H4 (3.0.6).

The Mnemo Note Manager is the Horde notes/memos application. It allows users to
keep web-based notes and freeform text. Notes may be shared with other users
via shared notepads. It requires the Horde Application Framework and an SQL
database or Kolab server for backend storage. For more information on Mnemo,
visit http://www.horde.org/apps/mnemo.

The major changes compared to the Mnemo version H4 (3.0.5) are:
    * Updated Hungarian, Italian, and Swedish translations.
