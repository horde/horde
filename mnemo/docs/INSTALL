 Installing Mnemo 3.0
======================

This document contains instructions for installing the Mnemo web-based notes
application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Mnemo, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Mnemo distribution.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Mnemo requires the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Mnemo runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Mnemo.

   .. Important:: Mnemo 3.0 requires version 4.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Mnemo. Many of Mnemo's prerequisites are also
                  Horde prerequisites. Additionally, many of Mnemo's optional
                  features are configured via the Horde install.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/apps/horde

2. SQL support in PHP *or* a configured Kolab Server.

   Mnemo will store its data in either an SQL database or on a Kolab Server.
   If you use SQL, build PHP with whichever SQL driver you require; see the
   Horde INSTALL_ file for details.


Installing Mnemo
================

The **RECOMMENDED** way to install Mnemo is using the PEAR installer.
Alternatively, if you want to run the latest development code or get the
latest not yet released fixes, you can install Mnemo from Git.

Installing with PEAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First follow the instructions in `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ to prepare a PEAR
environment for Horde and install the Horde Framework.

When installing Mnemo through PEAR now, the installer will automatically
install any dependencies of Mnemo too. If you want to install Mnemo with all
optional dependencies, but without the binary PECL packages that need to be
compiled, specify both the ``-a`` and the ``-B`` flag::

   pear install -a -B horde/mnemo

By default, only the required dependencies will be installed::

   pear install horde/mnemo

If you want to install Mnemo even with all binary dependencies, you need to
remove the ``-B`` flag. Please note that this might also try to install PHP
extensions through PECL that might need further configuration or activation in
your PHP configuration::

   pear install -a horde/mnemo

Installing from Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See::

   http://horde.org/source/git.php


Configuring Mnemo
=================

1. Configuring Horde for Mnemo

   Mnemo requires a permanent ``Shares`` backend in Horde to manage notepads
   and to add notes to notepads.  If you didn't setup a Share backend yet, go
   to the configuration interface, select Horde from the list of applications
   and select the ``Shares`` tab. Unless you are using Kolab, you should select
   ``SQL``.

2. Configuring Mnemo

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Mnemo.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``Notes`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Notes Configuration`` to generate the ``conf.php``
   file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to the Mnemo
   configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the file.  In
   this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the other methods
   to create the configuration file ``mnemo/config/conf.php``.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of the other configuration files in
   the ``config/`` directory can be found in each file. You may create
   ``*.local.php`` versions of these files if you wish to customize Mnemo's
   appearance and behavior. See the header of the configuration files for
   details and examples. The defaults will be correct for most sites.

3. Creating the database table

   Once you finished the configuration in the previous step, you can create all
   database tables by clicking the ``DB schema is out of date.`` link in the
   Mnemo row of the configuration screen.

   Alternatively you creating the Mnemo database tables can be accomplished with
   horde's ``horde-db-migrate`` utility.  If your database is properly setup in
   the Horde configuration, just run the following::

      horde/bin/horde-db-migrate mnemo

4. Testing Mnemo

   Use Mnemo to create, modify, and delete notes. Test at least the following:

   - Creating a new note
   - Modifying a note
   - Deleting a note
