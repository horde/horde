======================
 Installing Mnemo 3.0
======================

This document contains instructions for installing the Mnemo web-based notes
application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Mnemo, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Mnemo distribution.


Obtaining Mnemo
===============

Mnemo can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/mnemo/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/mnemo/

Bleeding-edge development versions of Mnemo are available via CVS; see the
file `docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution for information on accessing
the Horde CVS repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Mnemo requires the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Mnemo runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Mnemo.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Mnemo's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.  Be sure to
   have completed all of the steps in the INSTALL_ file for the Horde
   Framework before installing Mnemo.

2. SQL support in PHP.

   Mnemo stores its data in an SQL database.  Build PHP with whichever SQL
   driver you require; see the Horde INSTALL_ file for details.


Installing Mnemo
================

Mnemo is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, Mnemo is installed directly underneath Horde in the
webserver's document tree.

Since Mnemo is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For
example, with the Apache webserver's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/mnemo-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv mnemo-x.y.z mnemo

and would then find Mnemo at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/mnemo/


Configuring Mnemo
=================

1. Configuring Horde for Mnemo

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['mnemo']``
      stanza.  The default settings here should be okay for most
      installations, but you can change them if desired, or if you have a
      non-standard install.  If you have changed the location of Mnemo
      relative to Horde, either in the URL or in the filesystem or both, then
      you must update the ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their
      correct values.

   b. Configuring a DataTree backend

      Mnemo requires a permanent ``DataTree`` backend in Horde to manage
      notepads and to add notes to notepads.  If you didn't setup a DataTree
      backend yet, go to the configuration interface, select Horde from the
      list of applications and select a driver different than ``None`` on the
      ``DataTree System`` tab.  Make sure that you ran the necessary scripts
      to create a storage backend for the DataTree system, e.g. one of the
      ``create.*.sql`` or ``horde_datatree.*.sql`` SQL scripts in
      ``horde/scripts/sql/``.  You should have done this already during the
      installation of Horde.

2. Creating the database table

   The specific steps to create the Mnemo database table depend on which
   database you've chosen to use.

   First, look in ``scripts/sql/`` to see if a script already exists for your
   database type.  If so, you should be able to simply execute that script as
   superuser in your database.  (Note that executing the script as the "horde"
   user will probably fail when granting privileges.)

   If such a script does not exist, you'll need to build your own, using the
   file mnemo.sql as a starting point.  If you need assistance in creating
   databases, you may wish to let us know on the Mnemo mailing list.

3. Configuring Mnemo

   To configure Mnemo, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Documentation on the format of those files can be found in each file.  With
   the exception of the ``conf.*`` files (see below), the other files in
   ``config/`` need only be modified if you wish to customize Mnemo's
   appearance or behavior, as the defaults will be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Mnemo.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``Notes`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Notes Configuration`` to generate the ``conf.php``
   file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to the Mnemo
   configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the file.  In
   this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the other methods
   to create the configuration file ``mnemo/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Nag uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

4. Testing Mnemo

   Use Mnemo to create, modify, and delete notes. Test at least the following:

   - Creating a new memo
   - Modifying a memo
   - Deleting a memo
